				"abstract": "This article presents the authors' study of how detailed financial statement data enter the decisions of market participants by examining whether current changes in the signals are informative about subsequent earnings changes. By examining the relations between the fundamental signals and future earnings, the authors also establish a benchmark for assessing how efficiently analysts use the signals. The study's results suggest that analysts' forecast revisions fail to impound all the information, about future earnings contained in the fundamental signals. Furthermore, the results support the validity of much of the economic intuition that has been used to link current accounting information to earnings. The authors conclude that analysts' revisions of earnings forecasts are associated with many of the signals that predict future earnings.",

				"abstract": "This paper seeks to examine some of the dynamic interactions of stock prices and macroeconomic factors in five ASEAN countries, Indonesia; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; and Thailand with particular attention to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and period onwards. Using monthly time series data of the countries, accounting innovation analyses based on vector autoregressive (VAR) analytical framework is employed to empirically examine the interaction among the variables. This research reveals that, firstly, a shock to a particular variable in the model results in various contemporaneous reactions by other variables across the countries during the sample period. Secondly, the general forecast error variance decomposition results likely reinforce the outcomes of the general impulse response analyses in most of the countries.$backslash$n$backslash$n$backslash$nAbstract in Bahasa Indonesia : $backslash$n$backslash$nMakalah ini ditujukan untuk mengkaji berbagai interaksi dinamik yang terjadi antara indeks harga saham dan factor-faktor ekonomi makro di kelima negara-negara ASEAN, yaitu Indonesia; Malaysia; Filipina; Singapura; dan Thailand pada saat dan setelah berlangsungnya krisis keuangan Asia tahun 1997. Dengan menggunakan data time series bulanan dari negara-negara tersebut, accounting innovation analysis yang didasarkan atas kerangka analisa vector autoregressive (VAR) diaplikasikan untuk menguji secara empiris interaksi dinamik antara berbagai variabel tersebut. Penelitian ini mengungkapkan bahwa, pertama, suatu goncangan terhadap suatu variabel tertentu di dalam model menghasilkan berbagai reaksi temporer oleh variabel-variabel lainnya di seluruh negara-negara tersebut selama periode penelitian. Kedua, hasil-hasil analisa general forecast error variance decomposition nampaknya cenderung memperkuat hasil-hasil dari analisa general impulse response di sebagian besar negara-negara ASEAN tersebut.$backslash$n$backslash$nKata kunci: analisa accounting innovation, krisis keuangan Asia, pasar modal, faktor-faktor ekonomi makro, VAR.",

				"abstract": "The lack of studies regarding the determinants of stock price movement in the Indonesia Stock Exchange (ISX), which is an emerging stock exchange in the South East Asia region, and the pursue of generalization became the reasons of why this study. Previous research (Gupta, Chevalier, & Sayekt, 2000; Subiyantoro & Andreani, 2003), mostly focus on the external factors of the firms, instead of the internal factors. This study uses the accounting ratios as the determinants of the prices of stocks' classified as the LQ45 in the ISX during 2002-2006. The panel-data regression model is used to test whether all of the independent variables involved in the equation could simultaneously explain the behavior of the dependent one. The developed model would be analyzed by the utilization of econometrics package, namely GRETL 1.7.4. After conducting some statistical treatments on the developed model, this study reveals that the shareholders' ratios consisted of book value per share, dividend payout ratio, EPS, and ROA are the accounting ratios, which determine the LQ45's stock price movement in the ISX during the period of 2002-2006.",

				"abstract": "This paper is mainly concerned about intelligent forecasting for financial time series subject to structural changes. For example, it is well known that interest rates are subject to structural changes due to external shocks such as government monetary policy change. Such structural changes usually make prediction harder if they are not properly taken care of. Recently, Oh and Kim (2002a, 2002b) suggested a method that could handle such difficulties efficiently. Their basic idea is to assume that different probabilistic law (and hence different predictor) works for different situations. Their method is termed as two-stage piecewise nonlinear prediction since it is comprised of establishing various situations empirically and then installing a different probabilistic nonlinear law as predictor on each of them. Thus, for its proper prediction functioning, it is essential to identify the law dictating the financial time series presently. In this article we propose and study a mixing approach for better identification of the presently working probabilistic law.",

The ECM results reveal significant short-run and long-run feedback relations between the two financial markets. Specifically, the results show that an increase in aggregate domestic stock price has a negative short-run effect on domestic currency value. In the long run, however, increases in stock prices have a positive effect on domestic currency value.

Am. Econ. Rev. 71 (1981) 421-436.]. The conditional variance bound relationship is examined using cross-sectional data simulated from the general equilibrium asset pricing model of Brock [Asset prices in a production economy, in: J.J. McCall (Ed.), The Economics of Information and Uncertainty, University of Chicago Press, Chicago (for N.B.E.R.), 1982]. Results show that the conditional variance bounds hold, hence, our hypothesis of the validity of the dividend discount model cannot be rejected. Moreover, in our setting, markets are efficient and stock prices are neither affected by herd psychology nor by the outcome of noise trading by naive investors; thus, we are able to control for market efficiency. Consequently, we show that one cannot infer any conclusions about market efficiency from the unconditional variance bounds tests. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Fairfield et al.'s (1996) regression approach is used for predicting next period's return of equity (ROE) and stock prices using disaggregated earnings data. The results show that the mean adjusted R -square significantly increases with the progressive disaggregation of earnings. The results also demonstrate that disaggregated components are better able to predict next period earnings and stock prices than aggregated earnings. The findings support the US Financial Accounting Standard Board's contention that disaggregated information may be more useful than aggregated information for investment, credit, and financing decisions. Investors and analysts should use disaggregated income statement information in predicting next period earnings and stock prices for the banking industry. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how fully disaggregated earnings explain ROE, stock prices, and analysts forecast error in the banking industry.",

In particular, both the short and long run dynamics between stock prices and fund units are investigated. The novelty of our paper is the use of the hidden cointegration technique which attempts to capture heterogeneous fund flow reactions when stock index prices move up or down. Moreover, we employ the crouching error correction model (CECM) to assess the relationship between stock market movements and fund flow changes. The results show that stock prices and mutual fund units are cointegrated. In the case of positive movements there is a bi-directional effect interconnecting them, whereas for negative movements, causality runs only from fund flows to stock prices. The dynamics structure provides evidence that market microstructure, taxation and investors' sentiment affect stock price and unit formation. textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

On balance, regression analysis on the nine markets shows negative relationships between stock returns in real terms and inflation in the short run, while co-integration tests on the same markets display a positive relationship between the same variables over the long run. The time path of the response of stock prices plotted against corresponding changes in consumer price indices validates this dichotomy in time-related response patterns of stock prices to inflation; namely, a blip of negative responses at the beginning changes to a positive response over a longer period of time. Stock prices in Asia, like those in the U.S. and Europe, appear to reflect a time-varying memory associated with inflation shocks that make stock portfolios a reasonably good hedge against inflation in the long run.",

				"abstract": "Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.",

				"abstract": "In this paper we show that even a strongly efficient stock market is, by itself, insufficient to discipline managers who may hold incorrect beliefs about investors' behavior and their decision rules. Instead of disciplining the managers, the stock market may generate prices that reinforce these incorrect beliefs. When this happens, the disciplining of managers must be accomplished through other mechanisms, such as through markets for managerial labor, mergers and takeovers, the financial press, and education. These alternative mechanisms may produce slower disciplinary reactions than the stock market. Several important classes of accounting phenomena seem consistent with a failure of the stock market to discipline managers promptly. We present in detail how the apparent failure of managers to make cashflow-maximizing LIFO-FIFO choices in a timely fashion is consistent with this theory. Our approach is also applicable to other financial reporting conundrums in which adverse managerial and stock market reactions were predicted in response to Financial Accounting Standard No. 2 (accounting for research and development outlays), Standard No. 8 (foreign exchange translation), and Standard No. 19 (accounting for oil and gas exploration costs), each of which changed firms' accounting incomes but not their cash flows. Classical Arrow-Debreu models, as well as the rational expectations models, assume that firms are run by managers who seek to maximize the \"market value\" of the firm. Since the main purpose of such models is to examine the Pareto efficiency of wealth allocations by the stock market under the presumed behavior of management, this assumption has been useful in bypassing the extremely difficult problems of managerial compensation contracts and motivation. Formal examination of these contracts in the agency theory literature (e.g., Mirrlees [1976] and Holmstrom [1979]) has concluded that in the presence of moral hazard, appropriate incentives are provided to...

We find that a reduction in the minimum trading unit greatly increases a firm's base of individual investors and its stock liquidity, and is asso- ciated with a significant increase in the stock price.

				"abstract": "Time series forecasting have been a subject of interest in several different areas of research such as: meteorology, demography, health, computer and finance. Since it can be applied to various practical problems in real world, techniques to predict time series have been a topic of increasing research activities, especially in the financial sector that has a great interest in the forecast of the stock market. In this article, we are interested in the forecast of the time series related to the Brazilian oil company, Petrobras (PETR4). A methodology based on information obtained from exogenous series was used in combination with a neural network to predict the PETR4 stock series. Exogenous series were selected by analyzing the correlation between the series with the Petrobras stocks series. In this way, the prediction was obtained by not just using the previous values of the series but also by using information external to the PETR4 series. The values of the selected series were used as features for a prediction stage based on combined neural networks. To evaluate the performance of the system classical measurements were used, however we also introduce a new performance index called sum of the losses and gains (SLG).",

				"abstract": "There is a widespread concern among practitioners and corporate managers that transactions which result in changes in future earnings-per-share (鎻圥S锟? have real effects on stock prices, irrespective of whether these changes reflect differences in future cash flows. As a result, investment decisions are often conditioned on their being accretive to EPS. This paper addresses this notion by testing whether there is any relation between EPS accretion and both announcement and long-term abnormal returns for acquiring firms in mergers and acquisitions. Using a sample of 224 transactions completed between 1975 and 1994, and a measure of EPS accretion designed to exclude the real effects of any potential synergies from the acquisition, I find that EPS accretion has a positive and statistically significant effect on acquirer abnormal performance, both at announcement and for the period up to 18 months following completion of the deal. This effect is robust across different measures of abnormal performance, and after controlling for other factors known to affect the long-term performance of acquiring firms. Also, the magnitude of the effect is higher for firms with a larger percentage of unsophisticated investors. On the other hand, the estimated effect, although reliably positive, is one order of magnitude smaller than implied by practitioners锟?views, suggesting that the concerns expressed by managers are largely exaggerated.",

Firms are grouped into various life cycle portfolios using dividend payout, sales growth, and age. As predicted, the empirical results indicate a monotonic decline in the response coefficients of unexpected sales growth and unexpected capital investment from the growth to the stagnant stages. Additional analysis suggests that this relation is not driven by a firm size effect, risk differences, or measurement error in the proxies for performance measures.",

				"abstract": "This paper analyzes factors influencing stock prices for firms listed in the Nairobi stock exchange covering the period the period from January 2008 to December, 2010 using inflation, exchange rates, interest rates and money supply. The period is so as to use the most recent data, to make the findings more current. The study uses secondary data the main source of which is the NSE and the Central Bank of Kenya statistics. Multiple regression formula was applied to estimate effect of the factors on stock prices. The regression results show that the factors of inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates were significant except money supply which although it had a positive correlation, the relationship was not significant. The result shows that exchange and interest rates had negative correlation to stock prices whereas inflation and money supply had a positive correlation. Factor models observe the sensitivity of an asset return as a function of one or more factors. To formulate appropriate investment strategy, investors constantly review current financial and economic conditions, based on which future trends can be forecast considering the needs of the investors. However the financial market expectation will determine the investment strategy to be chosen. Financial markets are dynamic, and affected by various macroeconomic factors. The result of the study may offer investors and policy makers a basis upon which to make strategic decisions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

There is a marked increase in correlations between these markets around 2000, which we attribute to globalization and model with a time-varying smooth transition conditional correlation (STCC) GARCH specification. A double transition correlation model with time and US stock price volatility indicates that correlations not only increase over time but also during periods of high volatility. The STCC models perform well in comparison with constant and dynamic conditional correlation models in terms of both statistical and economic criteria, but we demonstrate that an investor will gain little from portfolio diversification across these two important markets.

The 2-VD describes the local curvature short-range correlations. We have resulted into ranking the 2-VD data according to their frequency of occurrence. After having tested the ideas and estimated the error bars on a Brownian motion signal, we have examined two stocks, i.e. SGP and OXHP closing price and volume of transaction long series. A precise (m, k)-Zipf diagram analysis when m = 6, k = 2 has been shown to lead to a non-immediate information on the signal behavior, even taking into account error bars. The set of curvatures (translated into 'words') indicates a Brownian motion-like set for the closing price local curvature of such signals over a 6 day span. Moreover, it has been shown that the conjecture about a simple relationship between the Hurst exponent H and the ?? exponent of Zipf plots does not seem to be substantiated here.",

In this paper, a fuzzy model evolved through a bio-inspired algorithm is proposed to produce accurate models for the prediction of these time series. The performance of this model is compared to that of a group of state-of-the-art statistical models. A thorough experimental study is designed and carry out in order to assess the merits of the proposal. The experimental results allow us to state that our proposal forecasts consistently outperform the other considered methods. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "Detection of turning points is a critical task for financial forecasting applications. This chapter proposes a comparison between two different classification approaches on such a problem. Nature-Inspired methodologies are attracting growing interest due to their ability to cope with complex tasks like classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection problems. A swarm intelligence algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and an artificial immune system algorithm, namely Negative Selection (NS), have been applied to the task of detecting turning points, modeled as an Anomaly Detection (AD) problem. Particular attention has also been given to the choice of the features considered as inputs to the classifiers, due to the significant impact they may have on the overall accuracy of the approach. In this work, starting from a set of eight input features, feature selection has been carried out by means of a greedy hill climbing algorithm, in order to analyze the incidence of feature reduction on the global accuracy of the approach. The performances obtained from the two approaches have also been compared to other traditional machine learning techniques implemented by WEKA and both methods have been found to give interesting results with respect to traditional techniques. textcopyright 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

First, test results reveal that a stable long-term relationship exists between broad money (M2) and its determinants including real income, foreign interest rate, and stock prices. Second, stock prices have a significant substitute (positive) effect on long-run broad-money (M2) demand and its omission can lead to serious misspecification in the money demand function in both the short- and long-run. Finally, we demonstrate that long-run income elasticity is not significantly different from unity with the inclusion of stock prices in the money demand equation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We are then led to a finding and, namely, that the transition rate of the random walk process is different from the frequency of transactions. Our results allow us to obtain a fast and reliable determination of the diffusion coefficient and precisely confirm that fat tails in the distribution of price variations are due to volatility fluctuations.",

				"abstract": "There is a huge literature suggesting that stock price movements reflect the market's ex-pectation of future developments in the econ-omy. As a test of standard valuation models, Eugene F. Fama (1990) shows that monthly, quarterly, and annual stock returns are highly correlated with future production growth rates for the 1953–1987 period. This result is con-firmed on a extended sample (1889 –1988) by G. William Schwert (1990). Both authors argue that the relationship between current stock re-turns and future production growth reflects ex-pectations about future cash flow that is impounded in stock prices. There is also a huge literature, and a long tradition in macroeconomics (from Arthur C. Pigou, 1927, and John Maynard Keynes, 1936, to the survey of Jess Benhabib and Roger E. A. Farmer, 1999) suggesting that changes in expectation may be an important ele-ment driving economic fluctuations. Given this, it is surprising that the empirical macro literature— especially the VAR-based liter-ature—rarely exploits stock price movements to expand our understanding of the role of expecta-tions in business cycle fluctuations. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by showing how stock price movements, in conjunction with movements in total factor productivity (TFP), can be fruitfully used to help shed new light on the forces driving business cycle fluctuation. The empirical strategy we adopt in this paper is to perform two different orthogonalization schemes as a means of identifying properties of the data that can then be used to evaluate theo-ries of business cycles. Let us be clear that our empirical strategy is a purely descriptive device which becomes of interest only when its impli-cations are compared with those of structural models. The two orthogonalization schemes we use are based on imposing sequentially, not simultaneously, either impact or long-run re-strictions on the orthogonalized moving average representation of the data. The primary system of variables that interests us is one composed of an index of stock market value and measured TFP. Our interest in focusing on stock market information is motivated by the view that stock prices are likely a good variable for capturing any changes in agents' expectations about fu-ture economic conditions. The two disturbances we isolate with our procedure are: a disturbance that represents in-novations in stock prices, which are orthogonal to innovations in TFP; and a disturbance that drives long-run movements in TFP. The main intriguing observation we uncover is that these two disturbances—when isolated separately without imposing orthogonality—are found to be almost perfectly colinear and to induce the same dynamics. We also show that these colin-ear shock series cause standard business cycle comovements and explain a large fraction of business cycle fluctuations. Moreover, when we use measures of TFP which control for variable rates of factor utilization, as, for example, when we use the series constructed by Basu et al. (2002), we find that our shock series anticipates TFP growth by several years. In order to interpret the result from our em-pirical exercise, we present a model where tech-nological innovations affect productive capacity with delay, and show how such a model can explain quite easily the patterns observed in the data. In particular, our evidence suggests that business cycles may be driven to a large extent by TFP growth that is heavily anticipated by economic agents, thereby leading to what might be called expectation-driven booms. Hence, our empirical results suggest that an important faction of business cycle fluctuations may be driven by",

The observed market reaction persists after eliminating firms with confounding releases and firms for which analysts' reports are issued immediately prior to publication. The evidence indicates that \"HS\" is not usually a secondary dissemination. First, stock prices adjust prior to publication when recommendations are reported on a single firm. Second, analysts have incentives to release information to \"HS\" before disseminating it to their clients. Overall, the evidence suggests that \"HS\" gathers information, forms a consensus, and provides it to investors.",

We present ex ante forecasting evidence which suggests that ARFIMA models estimated using a variety of standard estimation procedures yield \"approximations\" to the true unknown underlying DGPs that sometimes provide significantly better out-of-sample predictions than AR, MA, ARMA, GARCH, and related models, based on analysis of point mean-square forecast errors (MSFEs), and based on the use of predictive accuracy tests. The strongest evidence in favor of ARFIMA models arises when various transformations of 5 major stock index returns are examined. Additional evidence based on analysis of the Stock and Watson (J. Bus. Econom. Stat. 20 (2002) 147-162) data set, the returns series data set examined by Ding et al. (J.

These matrices can be seen as random, real, asymmetric matrices with a special structure superimposed due to the time-shift. We demonstrate that the associated eigenvalue spectrum is circular symmetric in the complex plane for large matrices. This fact allows us to exactly compute the eigenvalue density via an inverse Abel-transform of the density of the symmetrized problem. We demonstrate the validity of this approach by numerically computing eigenvalue spectra of lagged correlation matrices based on uncorrelated, Gaussian distributed time-series. We then compare our theoretical findings with eigenvalue densities obtained from actual high frequency (5 min) data of the S&P500 and discuss the observed deviations. We identify various non-trivial, non-random patterns and find asymmetric dependencies associated with eigenvalues departing strongly from the Gaussian prediction in the imaginary part. For the same time-series, with the market contribution removed, we observe strong clustering of stocks, i.e. causal sectors. We finally comment on the time-stability of the observed patterns.",

We begin by assuming that the return required by wealth holders is constant, and then relax this assumption by allowing the risk-free rate to vary over time and the risk premium to be time varying. The time-varying risk model produces fundamental prices that are closest to actual prices. The time-series characteristics of deviations from fundamental value suggest that deviations are similar over different time horizons and observational frequency and appear to be driven by nonlinearities in the price-output relationship rather than irrational investor behaviour. textcopyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

A taxable investor who concentrates his portfolio in low yield securities cannot tell from the data whether he is increasing or decreasing his expected after-tax return by so doing. A tax exempt investor who concentrates his portfolio in high yield securities cannot tell from the data whether he is increasing or decreasing his expected return. We argue that the best method for testing the effects of dividend policy on stock prices is to test the effects of dividend yield on stock returns. Thus the fact that we cannot tell, using the best available methods, what effects dividend yield has on stock returns implies that we cannot tell what effect, if any, a change in dividend policy will have on a corporation's stock price. ?? 1974.",

In this paper, we investigate the long term relationship of stock prices of alternative energy companies with oil prices in a multivariate framework. To this end, we use threshold cointegration tests, which endogenously incorporate possible regime shifts in long run relationship of underlying variables. In contrast to the findings of the previous study by Managi and Okimoto (2013), our results indicate presence of cointegration among the variables with two endogenous structural breaks. This study confirms that ignoring the presence of structural breaks in a long time series data, as has been done in previous study, can produce misleading results. In terms of causality, while the stock prices of alternative energy companies are impacted by technology stock prices, oil prices and interest rates in the short run, there is no causality running towards prices of alternative energy stock prices in the long run. The study discusses the possible reasons behind the empirical findings and concludes with a discussion on short run and long run investment opportunities for the investors.",

				"abstract": "Movement of stocks in the financial market is a typical example of financial time series data. It is generally believed that past performance of a stock can indicate its future trend and so stock trend analysis is a popular activity in the financial community. In this chapter, we will explore the unique characteristics of financial time series data mining. Financial time series analysis came into being recently. Though the world's first stock exchange was established in the 18th century, stock trend analysis began only in the late 20th century. According to Tay et al. (2003) analysis of financial time series has been formally addressed only since 1980s. It is believed that financial time series data can speak for itself. By analyzing the data, one can understand the volatility, seasonal effects, liquidity, and price response and hence predict the movement of a stock. For example, the continuous downward movement of the S&P index during a short period of time allows investors to anticipate that majority of stocks will go down in immediate future. On the other hand, a sharp increase in interest rate makes investors speculate that a decrease in overall bond price will occur. Such conclusions can only be drawn after a detailed analysis of the historic stock data. There are many charts and figures related to stock index movements, change of exchange rates, and variations of bond prices, which can be encountered everyday. An example of such a financial time series data is shown in Figure 1. It is generally believed that through data analysis, analysts can exploit the temporal dependencies both in the deterministic (regression) and the stochastic (error) components of a model and can come up with better prediction models for future stock prices (Congdon, 2003).",

				"abstract": "It is generally believed that the power of unit root tests is determined only by the time span of observations, not by their sampling frequency.We showthat the sampling frequency doesmatter for stock data displaying fat tails and volatility clustering, such as financial time series. Our claim builds on recent work on unit root testing based on non-Gaussian GARCH-based likelihood functions. Such methods yield power gains in the presence of fat tails and volatility clustering, and the strength of these features increases with the sampling frequency. This is illustrated using local power calculations and an empirical application to real exchange rates.",

				"abstract": "The paper explores the inter-relationship between stock prices and earnings management by bidders in the context of the UK market for corporate control. On the one hand, the results show that inflating earnings prior to a bid does indeed seem to affect prices and to have implications for the pattern of abnormal returns documented at different stages of the M&A transaction – at earnings announcement, at bid announcement, and in the long-run. During the period leading up to the bid, the evidence suggests that earnings management can shape takeover activity, because it allows bidders to induce overvaluation and use their misvalued stock as acquisition currency. During the post-merger period, the results show that accrual mispricing induced by earnings management can at least partly explain the acquirers' negative returns. This in turn implies that investors' inability to see through the poor earnings quality of overvalued acquirers, rather than mean reversion alone, can at least partly predict these acquirers' underperformance. On the other hand, there is evidence that a reverse relation between stock prices and earnings management also holds, i.e. that prices can affect the acquirers' earnings management behaviour, and that both pricing and earnings management can vary between ‘hot' and ‘cold' markets.",

The SVR network consists of two layers of SVR: transformation layer and prediction layer. The SVRs in the transformation layer forms a modular network; but distinguished with con- ventional modular networks, the partition of the SVR modular network is based on the output domain that has much smaller dimension. Then the transformed outputs from the transforma- tion layer are used as the inputs for the SVR in prediction layer. The whole SVR network gives an online prediction of financial time series. Simulation results on the prediction of currency exchange rate between US dollar and Japanese Yen show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method",

Annales de l'Ecole Normale Superieure 1900;3:XVII:21-86], considered to be described by a (discrete or continuous) time sequence of random variables, i.e., a stochastic process. Sharp scaling exponents or unifractal behavior of such processes has been reported in several works [Mandelbrot BB. J Business 1963;36:394-419; Peters EE. Chaos and order in the capital markets. New York: Wiley, 1991; Mantegna RN, Stanley HE. Nature 1995;376:46-49; Evertsz CJG. Fractals. 1995;3:609-616; Bouchaud JP, Potters M. Theorie des risques financiers. Alea Saclay, 1997]. In this paper we investigate the question of scaling transformation of price processes by establishing a new connection between non-linear group theoretical methods and multifractal methods developed in mathematical physics. Using two sets of financial chronological time series, we show that the scaling transformation is a non-linear group action on the moments of the price increments. Its linear part has a spectral decomposition that puts in evidence a multifractal behavior of the price increments.",

It is found that returns on portfolios of firms that are followed by many analysts tend to lead those of firms that are followed by fewer analysts, even when the firms are of approximately the same size. Many analyst firms also tend to respond more rapidly to market returns than do few analyst firms, adjusting for firm size. This relation, however, is nonlinear, and the marginal effect of the number of analysts on the speed of price adjustment increases with the number of analysts.",

In so far as it is concerned with price effects, the former type generally focuses on the relation between new accounting information and short-term changes in stock prices. Valuation studies, on the other hand, are ostensibly concerned with the relation between the level of stock prices and accounting variables, generally earnings but in order to mitigate problems arising from omitted variables, valuation studies frequently use first differences and also consider the relation between changes in stock prices and changes in earnings. However, the distinction between the two types of study may be maintained by observing that market reaction studies generally analyze security returns over much shorter time interval.",

This influence of analyst recommendation changes on fund herding is stronger for downgrades, and among managers with greater career concerns. These findings indicate that career-concerned managers are incentivized to follow analyst information, and that man- agers have a greater tendency to herd on negative stock information, given the greater reputational and litigation risk of holding losing stocks. Furthermore, starting in the mid-1990s (when aggregate mutual fund equity own- ership is significantly higher), stocks traded by career-concerned herds of fund managers in response to analyst recommendation changes experience a significant same-quarter price impact, followed by a sharp subsequent price reversal. Our evidence suggests that analyst recommendation revisions induce herding by career-concerned fund managers, and that this type of trading has become price destabilizing with the increasing level of mutual fund ownership of stocks.",

The dates of the shifts are identified by estimating recursively a cointegration relationship. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compute appropriate statistics for stationarity tests.

We use the results from the synthetic time-series to interpret the measure of multifractality of real log-returns time-series. The main finding is that the aggregation horizon of the returns can introduce a strong bias effect on the measure of multifractality. This effect can become especially important when returns distributions have power law tails with exponents in the range (2, 5). We discuss the right aggregation horizon to mitigate this bias.",

It is motivated by previous work where it was shown that non-stationarity is not static within a financial time series but quite variable in nature. Initially unit-root tests were performed to isolate segments that were stationary or non-stationary at a pre-determined significance level and then various tests were conducted based on forecasting accuracy. The hypothesis of this research is that when using the de-trended/original observations from the time series the trend/level stationary segments should produce lower error measures and when the series are differenced the difference stationary (non-stationary) segments should have lower error. The results to date reveal that the effects of variable stationarity on learning with ANNs are a function of forecasting time-horizon, strength of the linear-time trend, sample size and persistence of the stationary process.",

				"abstract": "The effects of inflation adjustments of corporate earnings on market prices were tested by cross section regressions of 485 manufacturing companies for the period 1966-76 and subperiods. The basic data were company reports and stock prices. For the full period, market prices reflected the inventory valuation adjustment and the decline in real value of net financial liabilities fairly completely, but they reflected the adjustment for the understatement of depreciation to only a small extent. The surprisingly low effect of the depreciation adjustment could only be partly attributed to measurement error, but not entirely. The estimated effect of capital gains on stock prices was either in the wrong direction or negligible. The implication of the results is that market investors use a range of adjustments for the effects of inflation which differs from the estimates used in this study, though how and why they differ is not clear. The adjustments were much lower in the later period 1972-76 than in the earlier period 1966-71. This seemed inconsistent with the higher inflation rates in the later period. The explanation for the difference is not clear, but it may reflect the difficulties of judging the size of the adjustments in a period of rapid inflation.",

				"abstract": "The influence of the macroeconomy on the stock market is a subject of enduring importance and fascination to academics, investment professionals, and monetary policymakers. Academics have devoted much of their effort to models that link stock prices to consumption through the first-order conditions of individual investors. In contrast, most investment professionals have adopted a radically different perspective. The leading practitioner model of equity valuation, the so called \"Fed model,\" relates the yield on stocks to the yield of nominal Treasury bonds, often with an adjustment for the relative risk on stocks and bonds. Historically, the major influence of nominal bond yields has been the rate of inflation. Thus the Fed model implies that stock yields are highly correlated with inflation. In the late 1990's practitioners often argued that falling stock yields, and rising stock prices, were justified by declining inflation. Despite the empirical success of the Fed model as a behavioral description of stock prices, there is serious difficulty with this model as a rational explanation of stock prices. The problem with interpreting the relation between stock prices and inflation is that the main influence on the long-term nominal interest rate of inflation.",

				"abstract": "We study the capital investment, stock issuance, and cash savings behavior of non-tech manufacturers (old economy firms) during the 1990s technology bubble. Our empirical results show that high stock prices affect corporate policies because they relax financing constraints. During the tech bubble, constrained non-tech firms' investment responded strongly to \"high stock prices\" (specifically, the component of price that is not captured by fundamentals). They also issued stock in response to that overvaluation effect, saving part of the proceeds in their cash accounts. We find no such patterns for unconstrained non-tech firms, nor for tech firms. Our findings are not consistent with the notion that managers systematically issue overvalued stocks and invest in ways that transfer wealth from new to old shareholders. More broadly, they suggest that what appears to be overvaluation in one sector of the economy may have positive externalities for other sectors. textcopyright 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The GA searches for profitable patterns occurring simultaneously in the multi-dimensional time series. Based on the patterns found, the GA produces more robust investment strategies, since the simultaneity of patterns on different dimensions of the data, reinforces the strength of the trading decisions implemented.

				"abstract": "A novel type of learning machine called support vector machine (SVM) has been receiving increasing interest in areas ranging from its original application in pattern recognition to other applications such as regression estimation due to its remarkable generalization performance. This paper deals with the application of SVM in financial time series forecasting. The feasibility of applying SVM in financial forecasting is first examined by comparing it with the multilayer back-propagation (BP) neural network and the regularized radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The variability in performance of SVM with respect to the free parameters is investigated experimentally. Adaptive parameters are then proposed by incorporating the nonstationarity of financial time series into SVM. Five real futures contracts collated from the Chicago Mercantile Market are used as the data sets. The simulation shows that among the three methods, SVM outperforms the BP neural network in financial forecasting, and there are comparable generalization performance between SVM and the regularized RBF neural network. Furthermore, the free parameters of SVM have a great effect on the generalization performance. SVM with adaptive parameters can both achieve higher generalization performance and use fewer support vectors than the standard SVM in financial forecasting.",

				"abstract": "We calculate the Hurst exponent H(t) of several time series by dynamical implementation of a recently proposed scaling technique: the detrending moving average (DMA). In order to assess the accuracy of the technique, we calculate the exponent H(t) for artificial series, simulating monofractal Brownian paths, with assigned Hurst exponents H. We next calculate the exponent H(t) for the return of high-frequency (tick-by-tick sampled every minute) series of the German market. We find a much more pronounced time-variability in the local scaling exponent of financial series compared to the artificial ones. The DMA algorithm allows the calculation of the exponent H(t), without any a priori assumption on the stochastic process and on the probability distribution function of the random variables, as happens, for example, in the case of the Kitagawa grid and the extended Kalmann filtering methods. The present technique examines the local scaling exponent H(t) around a given instant of time. This is a significant advance with respect to the standard wavelet transform or to the higher-order power spectrum technique, which instead operate on the global properties of the series by Legendre or Fourier transform of qth-order moments. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

				"abstract": "-Financial markets are very important to the eco­ nomical and social organization of modern society. Due to they importance, several researchers have investigated how to predict future market movements by using both statistical and soft computing methods based on historical time series data. However, as a typical data stream, financial time series frequently present concept drift, which is a change in the relationship between input data and the target variable over time. The concept drift phenomenon affects negatively the forecasting accuracy since the learned model becomes outdated after a change in the current concept. In this paper we investigate how to handle concept drift in financial time series prediction in order to improve the forecasting accuracy. Two explicit drift detector mechanisms, namely the Drift Detection Mechanism (DDM) and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average for Concept Drift Detection Mechanism (ECDD), were investigated. The main contribution of this work is an approach that combines Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELM) with explicit drift detection, in which the OS-ELM updates the decision model just in the presence of concept drift in data. Experimental results showed that the use of drift detection was able to speed up the prediction time of OS-ELM maintaining equivalent accuracy.",

				"abstract": "Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades. Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially. Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.",

				"abstract": "Multilayer neural network has been successfully applied to the time series forecasting. Steepest descend, a popular learning algorithm for backpropagation network, converges slowly and has the difficulty in determining the network parameters. In this paper, conjugate gradient learning algorithm with restart procedure is introduced to overcome these problems. Also, the commonly used random weight initialization does not guarantee to generate a set of initial connection weights close to the optimal weights leading to slow convergence. Multiple linear regression (MLR) provides a better alternative for weight initialization. The daily trade data of the listed companies from Shanghai Stock Exchange is collected for technical analysis with the means of neural networks. Two learning algorithms and two weight initializations are compared. The results find that neural networks can model the time series satisfactorily, whatever which learning algorithm and weight initialization are adopted. However, the proposed conjugate gradient with MLR weight initialization requires a lower computation cost and learns better than steepest decent with random initialization.",

				"abstract": "The primary objective of the chapter entitled \"Risk and Returns Characteristics of the Six Southeast Asian Emerging Stock Markets\" is to investigate the behavior of stock returns of the six Southeast Asian emerging markets, namely Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan. The monthly stock returns basically are the first difference form of market price indices denominated in local currency (in percentage). The sample period is divided into two sub-periods to make a comparison of the market returns behavior between them. Based on the various ARCH type models, the market risk exhibits a considerable variation through time in both periods, except Indonesia and Malaysia for the pre-crisis, where the shocks to variance have persistent impact on the future changes of monthly stock returns. The stock markets seem to lose performance due to this crisis because of an increase in volatility and a decrease in the mean of returns in the entire period. Using the national CPI, M1, INT, and January seasonal variables at the monthly frequency, we find that the volatile features of stock returns and the market volatility are better explained by these exogenous variables regardless of the sample periods. Moreover, the expected mean of stock returns depends on its own lagged returns and the lagged disturbances. The primary objective of the chapter entitled \"Volatility Spillovers, and Price of Risk: Evidence from Six Southeast Asian Emerging Stock Markets Using a Multivariate GARCH-M Approach\" is to examine the influence from the major markets, on those six Southeast Asian emerging markets and examine interactions among those emerging markets. Moreover, the existence of a time-varying price of risk will be evaluated in this chapter. To address the changing unit price of risk, the two-step procedures (univariate GARCH-M and state space model) are used in this study. The empirical results imply that the first-order autocorrelation process rather than a random walk process, with the exception of the Taiwanese case, properly specifies variation in this variable. The capital investors put a high price on risk, when the market is in a downturn. Moreover, this time-varying price of risk has a strong explanatory power with respect to the market excess returns and volatility. The primary objective of the chapter entitled \"Stock Excess Returns and Local Macroeconomic Variables: Evidence from Six Southeast Asian Emerging Stock Markets\" is mainly to investigate the behavior of risk premium and the credibility of monetary authorities. Using similar sample periods and exogenous variables as in the first essay, we initially observe a negative mean and an increase in standard deviation of the monthly excess returns that reflect a poor performance of those emerging markets after 1997 Asian financial crisis, except in Taiwan. The results from various ARCH specifications show that the excess returns vary significantly through time with a high degree of persistence in conditional variance. These results support the previous findings that the stock markets have serious imperfections. We also find strong evidence that the monetary authorities have a serious credibility problem in the market place, with the exception of the Philippines and Malaysia. Overall, our evidence suggests that individual stock market movements are influenced by other markets and variables reflecting local information. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",

The future price of the stock is pre- dicted by this proposed model using technical indexes as input and the forecast- ing accuracy of the model can also be further improved by dividing the historic data into different clusters.

				"abstract": "This study examines the return and risk behaviour of Malaysian stock using the Composite Index and its component stocks. At the individual firm level, stock trading at the KLSE stabilizes over time within a trading day, while the index portfolio returns fail to reveal any systematic trading pattern which indicated price stabilization. During the study period, the KLSE utilized the call market system, a periodic single-price auction, to determine order-matching prices at the market open and close of both the morning and afternoon trading sessions. The results of this study suggests that no particular benefit of reducing market volatility is achieved by the call market system. We also document some evidence that trading volume and firm size are important factors which explain for autocorrelations, price reversals, and the behaviour of intra - and interday returns.",

				"abstract": "Using a regime collapse model, this paper analyzes the impact of foreign financial disturbances in the foreign exchange market on the economy under the assumption of perfect foresight. When there are foreign financial disturbances and the amount of foreign exchange reserves reaches the threshold, the government contracts the domestic credit so as to prevent an additional decrease in foreign reserves. The results show that the relative scale of the threshold for foreign reserves influences the timing of the regime collapse, the extent of domestic credit contraction, and the dynamic adjustment of the economy.",

Using Neuro-fuzzy networks are one of the most powerful tools for this estimation. The particular locally linear model type of these networks called LoLiMot are in interest because of their linear training and construction optimization. These network can be much efficient when be a recurrent network why can better capture the dynamism's order of dynamic processes. The Locally linear Neuro-Fuzzy model (LoLiMot) here is as basis for making recurrent. In this paper this network with a global state feedback is implemented and the accuracy and the results of this recurrent network on Dow Jones index as a financial time series are compared with the static LoLiMot.

				"abstract": "This paper tested the mean reversion behavior of stock prices in the hospitality and other industry sectors towards their fundamental values, namely earnings per share (EPS) and dividend per share (DPS). Cointegration test results showed that DPS is not a good proxy of fundamental values of stock prices in all sectors, while EPS can serve as a good proxy of fundamental values of stock prices only in the hospitality and construction sectors. Further, although hospitality stock prices have diverged away from their fundamental values from time to time, there exists an error correction mechanism in the market, which adjusts hospitality stock prices to return to their fundamental values. We also found that hospitality stock prices driven by their EPS are due to less noise trading and small size in the hospitality industry. Lastly, empirical findings suggest that hospitality stock investors should pay more attention to the underlying performance of hospitality stocks in terms of their earnings per share. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

				"abstract": "Evidence that asset returns are more highly correlated during volatile markets and during market downturns (see Longin and Solnik, 2001, and Ang and Chen, 2002) has lead some researchers to propose alternative models of dependence. In this paper we develop two simple goodness-of-fit tests for such models. We use these tests to determine whether the multivariate Normal or the Student's t copula models are compatible with U.S. equity return and exchange rate data. Both tests are robust to specifications of marginal distributions, and are based on the multivariate probability integral transform and kernel density estimation. The first test is consistent but requires the estimation of a multivariate density function and is recommended for testing the dependence structure between a small number of assets. The second test may not be consistent against all alternatives but it requires kernel estimation of only a univariate density function, and hence is useful for testing the dependence structure between a large number of assets. We justify our tests for both observable multivariate strictly stationary time series and for standardized innovations of GARCH models. A simulation study demonstrates the efficacy of both tests. When applied to equity return data and exchange rate return data, we find strong evidence against the normal copula, but little evidence against the more flexible Student's t copula.",

Contact process is a continuous time Markov process; one interpretation of this model is as a model for the spread of an infection, where the epidemic spreading mimics the interplay of local infections and recovery of individuals. From this financial model, we study the statistical behaviors of return time series, and the corresponding behaviors of returns for Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSECI) and Hang Seng Index (HSI) are also comparatively studied. Further, we investigate the Zipf distribution and multifractal phenomenon of returns and price changes. Zipf analysis and MF-DFA analysis are applied to investigate the natures of fluctuations for the stock market.textless/ptextgreater",

Panel methods amplify the power and precision of the estimation procedures, allowing to concentrating on both the short- and long-run relations. The results indicate that there exists a significant cointegration relationship between stock prices and dividends. These findings further support the existence of stock price increases relative to fundamentals. Different from previous studies, our results reveal that stock prices adhere to dividends and rational bubbles were nonexistent in the Taiwan's stock market. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

				"abstract": "This paper introduces an estimator of stock price volatility that eliminates, at least asymptotically, the biases that are caused by the discreteness of observed stock prices. Assuming that the observed stock prices are continuously monitored, an estimator is constructed using the notion of how quickly the price changes rather than how much the price changes. It is shown that this estimator has desirable asymptotic properties, including consistency and asymptotic normality. Also, through a simulation study, the authors show that it outperforms natural estimators for the low- and middle-priced stocks. Furthermore, the simulation study demonstrates that the proposed estimator is robust to certain misspecifications in measuring the time between price changes.",

In particular, we use changes in equity short interest following convertible bond issuance to identify convertible bond arbitrage activity and analyze its impact on stock market liquidity and prices for the period 1993 to 2006. There is considerable evidence of arbitrage-induced short selling resulting from issuance. Moreover, we find strong evidence that this activity is systematically related to liquidity improvements in the stock.

Empirical investigation is conducted by means of rolling correlation coefficients, the Johansen multivariate cointegration method, causality tests and band spectrum regression. Results show significant long-run relationship(s) and linkage between the Far East markets before, during, and after the crisis. The most significant linkage and relationship are found during the crisis period. Results mostly indicate larger US influence in all periods but some evidence of increasing Japanese influence is also shown. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "This paper uses two-variable autoregressions to characterize transitory components in GNP and stock prices. Shocks to GNP holding consumption constant are almost entirely transitory, and account for large fractions of the variance of GNP growth. If consumption does not change, consumers must think that any GNP change is transitory. The facts that the consumption/GNP ratio forecasts GNP growth and that consumption is nearly a random walk drive this result. An implication is that consumption provides a good estimate of the \"trend\" in GNP. Prices and dividends behave similarly: shocks to prices holding dividends constant are almost entirely transitory.",

				"abstract": "We demonstrate that legislation has a simple, yet previously undetected, impact on stock prices. Exploiting the voting record of legislators whose constituents are the affected industries, we show that the votes of these \"interested\" legislators capture important information seemingly ignored by the market. A long-short portfolio based on these legislators' views earns abnormal returns of over 90 basis points per month following the passage of legislation. Industries that we classify as beneficiaries of legislation experience significantly more positive earnings surprises and positive analyst revisions in the months following passage of the bill, as well as significantly higher future sales and profitability. We show that the more complex the legislation, the more difficulty the market has in assessing the impact of these bills. Further, the more concentrated the legislator's interest in the industry, the more informative are her votes for future returns. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

				"abstract": "We examined whether press reports on the collective mood of investors can predict changes in stock prices. We collected data on the use of emotion words in newspaper reports on traders' affect, coded these emotion words according to their location on an affective circumplex in terms of pleasantness and activation level, and created indices of collective mood for each trading day. Then, by using time series analyses, we examined whether these mood indices, depicting investors' emotion on a given trading day, could predict the next day's opening price of the stock market. The strongest findings showed that activated pleasant mood predicted increases in NASDAQ prices, while activated unpleasant mood predicted decreases in NASDAQ prices. We conclude that both valence and activation levels of collective mood are important in predicting trend continuation in stock prices.",

				"abstract": "The dynamics of the equal-time cross-correlation matrix of multivariate financial time series is explored by examination of the eigenvalue spectrum over sliding time windows. Empirical results for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 indices reveal that the dynamics of the small eigenvalues of the cross-correlation matrix, over these time windows, oppose those of the largest eigenvalue. This behaviour is shown to be independent of the size of the time window and the number of stocks examined. A basic one-factor model is then proposed, which captures the main dynamical features of the eigenvalue spectrum of the empirical data. Through the addition of perturbations to the one-factor model, (leading to a 'market plus sectors' model), additional sectoral features are added, resulting in an Inverse Participation Ratio comparable to that found for empirical data. By partitioning the eigenvalue time series, we then show that negative index returns, (drawdowns), are associated with periods where the largest eigenvalue is greatest, while positive index returns, (drawups), are associated with periods where the largest eigenvalue is smallest. The study of correlation dynamics provides some insight on the collective behaviour of traders with varying strategies. textcopyright 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we use the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform to calculate correlation matrices over different timescales and then explore the eigenvalue spectrum over sliding time windows. The dynamics of the eigenvalue spectrum at different times and scales provides insight into the interactions between the numerous constituents involved. Eigenvalue dynamics are examined for both medium and high-frequency equity returns, with the associated correlation structure shown to be dependent on both time and scale. Additionally, the Epps effect is established using this multivariate method and analyzed at longer scales than previously studied. A partition of the eigenvalue time-series demonstrates, at very short scales, the emergence of negative returns when the largest eigenvalue is greatest. Finally, a portfolio optimization shows the importance of timescale information in the context of risk management.",

				"abstract": "1. Behavioral finance: 1.1 The author started by describing the limit and underlying assumptions of the efficient market hypothesis. At 772 et seq. 1.2 \"Obviously people can make money in the stock market by analyzing information, but the key empirical point of the EMH held that investors could not use stale information to earn a higher return than mere compensation for bearing the risk of the investment. Risk was adjusted for the EMH by a pricing model, most famously by the \"capital asset pricing model\" (CAPM), which specified the risk associated with each stock. The empirical claim held that no investor can use stale information to get returns greater than justified by the associated risk that the CAPM defined for the investment.\" At 773. 1.3 The EMH certainly had legal implications in securities law, e.g. fraud-on-the-market theory, appraisal remedies, etc. At 774. 1.4 Challenges to the EMH: the framing of problem, memory and attention, bias, etc. These factors lead to the fact that many make decision not base on information but on other issues. At 776 et seq. 1.5 \"Shared mistaken belief\" theory: at 780 et seq. Issues include over-reaction and over-confidence, along with other biases. Eventually, it may cause a price-value discrepancy. 1.6 \"The interplay of various cognitive biases shows familiar patterns of price formation. One commonly observed phenomenon in market pricing histories [*784] is the occurrence of short-term trends followed by longer run trend reversals. n44 The short-term trends are a product of underreaction to individual bits of information not seen as significant and are explained by the conservatism bias (the slow updating of beliefs in the face of new information). The longer term reversals of those trends are a product of overreaction to cumulated bits of information perceived as manifesting conspicuous patterns and are explained by the representative heuristic.\" At 783-784. 1.7 \"For several reasons, sophisticated traders cannot eliminate the price-value discrepancies this behavior creates. First, all investors, even sophisticated traders, suffer from these biases to some degree. Second, even rational traders cannot escape the wrath of the biased errors. Third, securities lack good substitutes that enable the kind of risk arbitrage that perfectly - or even substantially - efficient markets require. Fourth, in these patterns it becomes a rational choice for arbitrageurs and other \"smart money\" to join the crowd rather than to try to beat it. Far from stepping in to correct the mistakes of the noise trader, arbitrageurs in the ballooning of such bubbles can make more money by participating in the rise by buying on the way up and attempting to sell before the fall down. n46 Accordingly, not only does investor sentiment drive the final nail into the EMH's coffin, this \"limited arbitrage\" offers the eulogy. n47\" At 785. 2. From cognitive biases, it follows with the need for investor governance to accommodate the biases. 2.1 Investor eduation: at 788 et seq. Including contents in the training. 2.2 The author argued that investor educaiton may be more effective that other regulation to protect investors. \"Investor education rather than investor regulation is probably the best way to respond to the increasing recognition of the substantial role that cognitive biases play in investor behavior.\" At 797. 2.3 The author suggested that the suitability and churning rules must change. At 797 et seq. 2.3.1 The suitability rule must contain psychological component. At 797. 2.3.2 \"It would not be difficult in such a meeting, or on the account form, to call attention to aspects of investor psychology in addition to investor financial condition. An applicant would check boxes according to investment objectives and also according to psychological profile. As with investment objectives, [*799] firms could choose which of various psychological factors seem most relevant to their understanding of what investments would suit a particular client.\" At 798-799. \"Of all the biases and factors that one could possibly ask about, however, one's degree of loss aversion is striking for its relevance, reliability, and accessibility. Loss aversion relates directly to problems of regret (a universal characteristic of claimants in nonsuitability cases); it is a good indicator of the sorts of securities that would or would not make the investor comfortable, and it is relatively easy to elicit through conversion and observation. One can express it in terms of personal value function, the degree to which the person differs in her weighting of gains versus losses. Brokers would then consider these profiles in relation to an investor's stated investment objectives. In some cases, brokers may have to reconcile the two according to some tradeoffs. For example, an investor checking \"speculation\" as her objective and also indicating a steep gain/loss value function would clearly need to reconsider at least one of her choices. The client could do this at the outset or choose to amend it in the course of investment selection. In any event, brokers would measure the suitability of investments in terms of both financial objectives and psychological profile.\" At 799. 2.4 There are other implications to the implementation of day trading and margin trading (at 802 et seq.) as well as corporate finance (at 806 et seq). 2.5 Impact on the litigation side: at 829 et seq, issues including the fraud-on-the-market theory (criticised as a bit too far-fetched by the author, at 831-832) and the appraisal remedy.",

The contribution of news about future discount rates is about four times that of news about future dividends, with no significant covariance between them. Our analysis of excess returns uncovers a positive covariance between news about dividends and news about real interest rates. Since these two elements have opposite effects on current stock prices, their combined effect is negligible. Persistence in expected returns, as well as predictability, are found to be important in explaining stock price movements.",

First, we consider macroeconomic news and show that it is difficult to explain more than one third of the return variance from this source. Second, to explore the possibility that the stock market responds to information that is omitted from our specifications, we also examine market moves coincident with major political and world events. The relatively small market responses to such news, along with evidence that large market moves often occur on days without any identifiable major news releases, casts doubt on the view that stock price movements are fully explicable by news about future cash flows and discount rates.",

				"abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid learning framework called Self Adaptive Differential Harmony Search Based Optimized Extreme Learning Machine (SADHS-OELM) for single hidden layer feed forward neural network (SLFN). The new learning paradigm seeks to take advantage of the generalization ability of extreme learning machines (ELM) along with the global learning capability of a self adaptive differential harmony search technique in order to optimize the fitting performance of SLFNs. SADHS is a variant of harmony search technique that uses the current to best mutation scheme of DE in the pitch adjustment operation for harmony improvisation process. SADHS has been used for optimal selection of the hidden layer parameters, the bias of neurons of the hidden-layer, and the regularization factor of robust least squares, whereas ELM has been applied to obtain the output weights analytically using a robust least squares solution. The proposed learning algorithm is applied on two SLFNs i.e. RBF and a low complexity Functional link Artificial Neural Networks (CEFLANN) for prediction of closing price and volatility of five different stock indices. The proposed learning scheme is also compared with other learning schemes like ELM, DE-OELM, DE, SADHS and two other variants of harmony search algorithm. Performance comparison of CEFLANN and RBF with different learning schemes clearly reveals that CEFLANN model trained with SADHS-OELM outperforms other learning methods and also the RBF model for both stock index and volatility prediction.",

				"abstract": "In this article, the author presents a simple stock price model for major country economies. The model assumes a long-run fair stock market value and short-run deviations from fair value. In the long run, only fundamentals matter. In addition to the discussion of earnings and the risk-free interest rate, the author considers a proxy for the long-run equity risk premium. In the short run, other factors might determine stock prices, such as the exchange rate, commodity prices, momentum, and seasonality. Out-of-sample forecasting statistics indicate that the stock price model clearly outperforms a random walk model. Exploiting the forecasting accuracy in practice is difficult, however, because the stock price determinants, especially the short-run risk premium, are difficult to predict. By contrast, the long-run stock price model reliably guides investors about the degree of over or undervaluation of stock markets from their long-run fair fundamental levels. Two different investment strategies illustrate the ability of the long-run stock price model to generate excess returns. - See more at: http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jpm.2008.706246#sthash.KweLAUN8.dpuf",

The test has several distinguishing features compared with other procedures. In particular, it has a standard null limit distribution and is the most efficient test when directed against the appropriate (fractional) alternatives. In addition, it allows us to test unit root cycles at each of the frequencies, and, thus, it permits us to approximate the number of periods per cycle. The results, based on the daily structure of Spanish Stock Market prices (IBEX35), show that some intra-year cycles occur, and they take place at approximately 6, 9 or between 24 and 50 periods. The analysis was extended to several other stock market indices of various countries and though the results differ in terms of frequencies, the same conclusions hold, finding evidence of intra-year cyclical effects in all countries.",

				"abstract": "A number of recent studies address the problem of assessing the contributions of market fundamentals and rational bubbles to stock-price fluctuations. This research paper implements such tests for explosive rational bubbles in stock prices using a model that assumes a constant discount rate, but that allows unobservable variables to affect market fundamentals and also allows different valuations of expected capital gains and expected dividends. This paper reports empirical tests for the existence of explosive rational bubbles in stock prices. The analysis focuses on a model that defines market fundamentals to be the sum of an unobservable variable and the expected present value of dividends, discounted at a constant rate, and defines a rational bubble to be a self-confirming divergence of stock prices from market fundamentals in response to extraneous variables. The pattern of autocorrelations in the data as well as Dickey-Fuller tests both indicate that stock prices and dividends are nonstationary before differencing, but are stationary in first differences. In contrast, first differences of simulated time-series of rational bubbles exhibit strong signs of nonstationarity.",

				"abstract": "We develop a discrete-time model in which the stock markets of two countries are linked via and with the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is characterized by nonlinear interactions between technical and fundamental traders. Such interactions may generate complex dynamics and recurrent switching between \"bull\" and \"bear\" market phases via a well-known pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcation path, when technical traders become more aggressive. The two stock markets are populated by fundamentalists, and prices tend to evolve towards stable steady states, driven by linear laws of motion. A connection between such markets is established by allowing investors to trade abroad, and the resulting three-dimensional dynamical system is analyzed. One goal of our paper is to explore potential spill-over effects between foreign exchange and stock markets. A second, related goal is to study how the bifurcation sequence which characterizes the market with heterogeneous speculators is modified in the presence of interactions with other markets. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.",

Our empirical analysis gives rise to two main issues. The first is related to the presence of an extra premium, i.e. \"alpha puzzle\". The second is the time-varying component of the quantity of risk, i.e. \"beta puzzle\". We find that local liquidity factors do not explain the presence of positive and statistically significant alphas. This puzzle is solved by means of transaction costs. In addition, we show that global liquidity factors, such as VIX and Open Interest, statistically affect the market price of risk. Our empirical finding proves the time varying nature of the global risk factors. Finally, we argue that standard asset pricing models cannot solve the two puzzles simultaneously. textcopyright 2012 University of Venice.",

Present formulation takes into account constraints on the number of stocks and on the fraction of capital invested in each of them, whilst not including transaction costs.

				"abstract": "The much publicized Tylenol incident in 1982 led to stringent packaging regulations for over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs. The sudden incident and the swift progression of associated events offer a unique opportunity to assess the wealth effects of the resultant regulations. The market value of common stock of Johnson & Johnson, makers of Tylenol, declined by approximately 29 percent, amounting to $2.31 billion. Although other firms in the industry also suffered significantly, their share price decline did not occur around the Tylenol incident but occurred around the subsequent packaging regulation proceedings. On average, 28 other pharmaceutical firms analyzed in this study experienced a decline of $310 million per firm, or a total of about $8.68 billion. The results suggest that the regulation had a significant negative effect on the common stock prices of firms in the pharmaceutical industry.",

				"abstract": "Engle and Russell's autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models have been proven successful in modelling financial data that arrive at irregular intervals. In practice, evaluating these models represents a crucial step. The spectral density is widely used in engineering and applied mathematics. Here, we advocate its use when testing for the so-called ACD effects, and for evaluating the adequacy of ACD models. Two classes of test statistics for duration clustering and one class of test statistics for the adequacy of ACD models are proposed. We adapt Hong's [Consistent testing for serial correlation of unknown form. Econometrica 1996;64:837-64; One-sided testing for conditional heteroskedasticity in time series models. Journal of Time Series Analysis 1997;18:253-77] approach in the context of evaluating ACD models. In particular, we justify rigorously the asymptotic distributions, which are all standard normal, of the test statistics in the ACD framework. When testing for ACD effects, the second class of test statistics exploits the one-sided nature of the alternative hypothesis and we discuss in which circumstances these test statistics should be more powerful. Using a particular kernel function, the classes based on integrated measures provide generalized versions of the classical Box-Pierce/Ljung-Box test statistics, which are popular procedures among practitioners. However, we obtain more powerful test procedures in many situations, using nonuniform kernels. Important aspects of the paper are a simulation study illustrating the merits of the proposed procedures in the ACD context, and applications with financial data. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the key problem is to cope with the volume of data to process, since a single execution trace could contain millions of calls. Although many trace analysis techniques have been proposed, most of them are not very scalable. To overcome this problem, we developed a segmentation technique where the trace is pre-processed to give it the shape of a time series of data. Then we apply technical analysis techniques borrowed from the financial domain. In particular we show how the moving average filtering can be used to identify the \"trend\" of the involvement of the class in the execution of the program. Based on the comparison of the \"trends\" of all the classes, one can compute the coupling of classes in order to recover the hidden functional architecture of the software.",

In general clustering of financial time series, due to their peculiar features, needs the definition of suitable distance measures. At this aim, the first fuzzy clustering model exploits the autoregressive representation of GARCH models and employs, in the framework of a partitioning around medoids algorithm, the classical autoregressive metric. The second fuzzy clustering model, also based on partitioning around medoids algorithm, uses the Caiado distance, a Mahalanobis-like distance, based on estimated GARCH parameters and covariances that takes into account the information about the volatility structure of time series. In order to illustrate the merits of the proposed fuzzy approaches an application to the problem of classifying 29 time series of Euro exchange rates against international currencies is presented and discussed, also comparing the fuzzy models with their crisp version. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

				"abstract": "Volatility characterizes the amplitude of price return fluctuations. It is a central magnitude in finance closely related to the risk of holding a certain asset. Despite its popularity on trading floors, volatility is unobservable and only the price is known. Diffusion theory has many common points with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that volatility is a time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for the price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from price data by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which together with the price forms a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a maximum-likelihood estimate of the volatility path valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion processes. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic volatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of volatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results are that (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is consistent with the expOU model, (ii) the estimated volatility is related to trading volume by a power law of the form sigma proportional, variant V0.55, and (iii) future returns are proportional to the current volatility, which suggests some degree of predictability for the size of future returns.",

				"abstract": "Based on a cointegrated VAR model, a joint test of the within-country and cross-country low-frequency implications of the present value model of stock prices is derived and applied to postwar annual stock market data from four European countries. Following Johansen (1995) and Johansen and Juselius (1994) the test is formulated as a test of overidentifying restrictions on multiple cointegration vectors. The analysis is similar in spirit to the analysis carried out by Kasa (1992). However, whereas Kasa analyses prices and dividends in two separate VAR models and does not test restrictions implied by the present value model on the cointegration vectors, we perform the analysis within one comprehensive VAR model and test the full set of within-country and cross-country implications by a single likelihood ratio test. The empirical results indicate the presence of common trends among dividends in the four countries; how many is, however, difficult to judge. Furthermore, the results of the tests of the overidentifying restrictions are not clearcut. If dividends share one or two common trends the restrictions are not rejected at standard significance levels. However, if dividends share three common trends, the restrictions are strongly rejected.",

As the correlation matrix reflects the more eigenvalue property, the estimated stock network from the correlation matrix gradually increases the degree of consistency with the original stock network.

We analyse the possible presence of threshold cointegration between real stock prices and dividends for the US market during the period from 1871:1 to 2004:6. According to our results, the null hypothesis of linear cointegration between stock prices and dividends is rejected in favour of a two-regime threshold cointegration model. We find also that stock prices do not respond to equilibrium error, and dividends respond to the past divergence only if the deviation from the equilibrium error does not exceed the estimated threshold parameter.

To validate the micro/ macro informer framework, we examine if an aggregate of Twitter messages can be used as a predictor of future stock prices of publicly traded companies. Our field study analyzes Twitter posts related to 18 Fortune500 companies using Latent Semantic Analysis to extract the semantic and conceptual content in the form of key themes. Using the factors comprising the themes, we fit a regression model that uses tweet volume and tweet topic strength to predict 8.3% of variability in stock prices beyond what is explained by the fluctuations of the stock market. Our results suggest that Twitter can be viewed as a macro informer for stock markets. This confirms our conjecture that SNS are both platforms for micro informing and macro informers.

They are based on different scaling laws for the distributions of jumps as a function of the lag. The first is a large deviation analysis, and the second is based on the concept of a self-similar process introduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness. We show that large deviation analysis does not apply to either the stock market nor fractional Brownian motion (H not equal 0.5). Instead the analysis based on self-similarity is applicable to both, and does indicate that especially the negative log-price fluctuations have a large degree of sell-similarity. The latter analysis allows one to probe the degree of self-similarity of a process, beyond what is possible with the exponent H typically used to describe self-affine graphs.",

Recent papers by Mandelbrot and Samuelson show rigorously that independence of successive price changes is colzsistent with an \"efficient\" market, i.e., a market that adjusts rapidly to new information. It is important to note, however, that in the empirical work to date the usual procedure has been to infer market efficiency from the observed independence of successive price changes. There has been very little actual testing of the speed of adjustment of prices to specijc kinds of new information.

				"abstract": "Although a lot of empirical research has studied the relationship between changes in oil prices and economic activity, it is surprising that little research has been conducted on the relationship between oil price shocks and the large Newly Industrialized Economies (NIEs). Therefore, this paper modifies the procedure of Kilian and Park (2009) and investigates how explicit structural shocks that characterize the endogenous character of changes in oil prices affect three large NIEs' stock-market returns, in order to fill this gap. From the empirical analysis, we find that the impact of oil price shocks on stock prices in these large NIEs is mixed, partly in contrast to the effects on the U.S. and developed countries' stock markets. This result is also consistent with the previous empirical findings that the NIEs' stock markets are “partially integrated” with the other stock markets and oil price shocks.",

To study the fluctuation behavior of the financial model, we present numerical research based on Monte Carlo simulation in conjunction with the statistical analysis and multifractal analysis of the financial time series. We extract the multifractal spectra by selecting various lattice size values of the Sierpinski carpet, and the inverse temperature of the Ising dynamic system. We also investigate the statistical fluctuation behavior, the time-varying volatility clustering, and the multifractality of returns for the indices SSE, SZSE, DJIA, IXIC, S&P500, HSI, N225, and for the simulation data derived from the Ising model on the Sierpinski carpet lattice. A numerical study of the model's dynamical properties reveals that this financial model reproduces important features of the empirical data. textcopyright 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "An artificial neural prediction system is automatically developed with the combinations of step wise regression analysis (SRA), dynamic learning and recursive-based particle swarm optimization (RPSO) learning algorithms. In the first stage, the SRA can be considered like a data filtering machine to choose two primary factors from 20 channel technical indexes as input variables of the RBFNs system. Then, an efficient dynamic learning algorithm is applied to sequentially generate RBFs functions from training data set, where it can efficiently determine the proper number of RBFs' centers and their associated positions. It can be exploited to forecast appropriate behaviors of the wanted identified financial time series data. While characteristics of training data set are automatically mined and generated by the proposed dynamic learning algorithm, architecture of the RBFNs prediction system is initially represented with collected information. Moreover, the RPSO learning scheme with the hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and recursive least-squares (RLS) learning methods are applied to extract those appropriate parameters of the RBFNs prediction system. The RBFNs prediction systems are implemented in data analysis, module generation and price trend of the financial time series data. It not only automatically determines proper RBFs number but also fast approach the desired target in actual trading of Taiwan stock index (TAIEX). Computer simulations in training and testing phases of historic TAIEX are compared with other learning methods, which illustrate our great performance not only increases the accuracy of the stock price prediction but also improves the win rate in the trend of TAIEX. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicate that utility shareholders earned, on average, significant negative abnormal returns during the 20-day period immediately following the accident. Firms using nuclear power experienced greater losses than did nonnuclear firms. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies on Three Mile Island. However, our results indicate no significant changes in systematic risk, total risk, or market risk as a result of the Chernobyl accident. textcopyright 1989.",

Those trends, which might coexist with some altered random walk paradigm and efficient market hypothesis, seem nevertheless difficult to reconcile with the celebrated Black-Scholes model. They are estimated via recent techniques stemming from control and signal theory. Several quite convincing computer simulations on the forecast of various financial quantities are depicted.

The main ideas of nonparametric kernel smoothing are explained in the rather simple situation of density estimation and regres- sion. For financial data, a rather relevant topic is nonparametric estimation of a volatility function in a continuous-time model such as a homogeneous dif- fusion model. We review results on nonparametric estimation for discretely observed processes, sampled at high or at low frequency. We also discuss application of nonparametric methods to testing, especially model validation and goodness-of-fit testing. In riskmeasurement for financial time series, con- ditional quantiles play an important role and nonparametric methods have been successfully applied in this field too. At the end of the chapter we discuss Grenander's sieve methods and other more recent advanced nonparametric approaches.",

				"abstract": "The difference between reported price-earnings ratios in the United States and Japan is not as puzzling as it appears at first glance. Nearly half the disparity is caused by differences in accounting practices with respect to consolidation of earnings from subsidiaries and depreciation of fixed assets. If Japanese firms used U.S. accounting rules, we estimate that the P/E ratio for the Tokyo Stock Exchange would have been 32.1, not the reported 54.3, at the end of 1988. Accounting differences are unable, however, to explain the sharp rise in the Japanese stock market during the mid-1980s. Changes in required returns on equities, or in investor expectations of future growth for Japanese firms, must be invoked to explain this phenomenon. Real interest rates declined during the period of rapid price increase, but there is little evidence that growth expectations became more optimistic. The real interest rate changes do not, however, appear large enough to fully account for the change in stock prices.",

Twins pool their cash flows, so, with integrated markets, twin stocks should move together. However, the difference between the prices of twin stocks appears to be correlated with the markets on which they are traded most, i.e., a twin's relative price rises when the market on which it is traded relatively intensively rises. We examine several explanations of this phenomenon including: the discretionary use of dividend income by parent companies: differences in parent expenditures; voting rights; currency fluctuations; ex-dividend date timing issues; and tax-induced investor heterogeneity. Only the last hypothesis can explain some, but not all, of the empirical facts. We conjecture that: (a) country-specific sentiment shocks might affect share intensity, (b) investors are rational, but markets are segmented by frictions other than international transactions costs, such as agency problems.",

				"abstract": "Low-frequency financial returns can be modelled as centered around piecewise-constant trend functions which change at certain points in time. We propose a new stochastic time series framework which captures this feature. The main ingredient of our model is a hierarchically-ordered oscillatory basis of simple piecewise-constant functions. It differs from the Fourier-like bases traditionally used in time series analysis in that it is determined by change-points, and hence needs to be estimated from the data before it can be used. The resulting model enables easy simulation and provides interpretable decomposition of non-stationarity into short-and long-term components. The model permits consistent estimation of the multiscale change-point-induced basis via binary segmentation, which results in a variable-span moving-average estimator of the current trend, and allows for short-term forecasting of the average return.",

				"abstract": "Recently, the increasing use of time series data has initiated various research and development attempts in the field of data and knowledge management. Time series data is characterized as large in data size, high dimensionality and update continuously. Moreover, the time series data is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical fields. Indeed, a large set of time series data is from stock market. Stock time series has its own characteristics over other time series. Moreover, dimensionality reduction is an essential step before many time series analysis and mining tasks. For these reasons, research is prompted to augment existing technologies and build new representation to manage financial time series data. In this paper, financial time series is represented according to the importance of the data points. With the concept of data point importance, a tree data structure, which supports incremental updating, is proposed to represent the time series and an access method for retrieving the time series data point from the tree, which is according to their order of importance, is introduced. This technique is capable to present the time series in different levels of detail and facilitate multi-resolution dimensionality reduction of the time series data. In this paper, different data point importance evaluation methods, a new updating method and two dimensionality reduction approaches are proposed and evaluated by a series of experiments. Finally, the application of the proposed representation on mobile environment is demonstrated. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the content of the model, we show that aggregate demand shocks have only temporary effects on real stock prices, while supply shocks may affect the level of real stock prices permanently. Moreover, the temporary component in U. S. stock prices, identified by placing appropriate structural restrictions on a vector autoregressive system estimated for the postwar period, is statistically significant. This evidence supports the mean-reversion hypothesis that stock prices are not pure random walks. The finding is robust to the choice of variables used in the vector autoregressive system and periodicity.",

Correlation measures are generally used to quantify the connections between equities. The 2008 financial crisis, and its aftermath, demonstrated the need for a better way to quantify these connections. We present a machine learning-based method to build a connectedness matrix to address the shortcomings of correlation in capturing events such as large losses. Our method uses an unconstrained optimization to learn this matrix, while ensuring that the resulting ma- trix is positive semi-definite. We show that this matrix can be used to build portfolios that not only “beat the market,” but also outperform optimal (i.e., minimum variance) portfolios.",

				"abstract": "Real estate investment trust (REIT) stock prices deviate substantially from net asset values (NAV). Using REIT data since 1990, we find large positive excess returns to a strategy of buying stocks that trade at a discount to NAV, and shorting stocks trading at a premium to NAV. Estimated alphas from this strategy are between 0.9% and 1.8% per month, with little risk. Trading costs and short-sale constraints are not prohibitive and the results strengthen when we control for differences in liquidity or the extent of institutional ownership. We find that some variation in P/NAV makes sense, as premiums are positively related to recent and future NAV growth. However, there appears to be too much volatility in P/NAV, giving rise to potential profits from short-term mean reversion. The closed-end fund literature has some similar findings on stock price deviations from fundamental value, but compared to closed-end funds REITs are much larger and have much higher insider and institutional ownership. These differences suggest that REIT premiums and discounts reflect more than just small investor sentiment, which is a common explanation of why closed-end fund prices deviate from their fundamental value.",

Especially, we propagate the use of a tailor-made selection of different estimation techniques that are used in various fields of time series analysis but until now have not consequently found their way into the finance literature. Following the idea of portfolio diversification, we show that considerable improvements with respect to robustness and unbiasedness can be achieved by using a basket of estimation methods. With this methodological toolbox at hand, we investigate real market data to show that noticeable deviations from the assumptions of constant self-similarity and absence of serial correlation occur during certain periods. On the one hand, this may shed a new light on seemingly ambiguous scientific findings concerning serial correlation of financial time series. On the other hand, a proven time-changing degree of self-similarity may help to explain high-volatility clusters of stock price indices.",

				"abstract": "This research focuses on using various higher order neural networks (HONNs) to predict the upcoming trends of financial signals. Two HONNs models: the Pi-Sigma neural network and the ridge polynomial neural network were used. Furthermore, a novel HONN architecture which combines the properties of both higher order and recurrent neural network was constructed, and is called dynamic ridge polynomial neural network (DRPNN). Extensive simulations for the prediction of one and five steps ahead of financial signals were performed. Simulation results indicate that DRPNN in most cases demonstrated advantages in capturing chaotic movement in the signals with an improvement in the profit return and rapid convergence over other network models. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

				"abstract": "We make use of wavelet transform to study the multi-scale, self-similar behavior and deviations thereof, in the stock prices of large companies, belonging to different economic sectors. The stock market returns exhibit multi-fractal characteristics, with some of the companies showing deviations at small and large scales. The fact that, the wavelets belonging to the Daubechies' (Db) basis enables one to isolate local polynomial trends of different degrees, plays the key role in isolating fluctuations at different scales. One of the primary motivations of this work is to study the emergence of the k-3 behavior [X. Gabaix, P. Gopikrishnan, V. Plerou, H. Stanley, A theory of power law distributions in financial market fluctuations, Nature 423 (2003) 267270] of the fluctuations starting with high frequency fluctuations. We make use of Db4 and Db6 basis sets to respectively isolate local linear and quadratic trends at different scales in order to study the statistical characteristics of these financial time series. The fluctuations reveal fat tail non-Gaussian behavior, unstable periodic modulations, at finer scales, from which the characteristic k-3 power law behavior emerges at sufficiently large scales. We further identify stable periodic behavior through the continuous Morlet wavelet. textcopyright 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "Proliferation of traded derivatives that relate to the same underlying—such as stocks, bonds, and credit default swaps (CDS) all tied to the value of an underlying firm—raises questions about which instrument leads the adjustment to a new equilibrium when information enters the market. In this article, the authors explore the issue of using CDS, bonds, and stocks of 10 financial firms before and during the crisis of 2008. Using a cointegration framework, they calculate each security's contribution to overall price discovery. They find the stock market to be the most informative, followed by the CDS market, with the bond market least of all. Before the crisis period, about two-thirds of price discovery occurred in the equity market and about one-quarter in the CDS market. From fall 2007 through 2008, however, the influence from stocks dropped to about 50%, while the CDS market's contribution increased to close to 40%.",

				"abstract": "We discuss the results of three recent phenomenological studies focussed on understanding the distinctive statistical properties of financial time series - (i) The probability distribution of stock price fluctuations: Stock price fluctuations occur in all magnitudes, in analogy to earthquakes - from tiny fluctuations to very drastic events, such as the crash of 19 October 1987, sometimes referred to as `Black Monday'. The distribution of price fluctuations decays with a power-law tail well outside the Levy stable regime and describes fluctuations that differ by as much as 8 orders of magnitude. In addition, this distribution preserves its functional form for fluctuations on time scales that differ by 3 orders of magnitude, from 1 min up to approximately 10 days. (ii) Correlations in financial time series: While price fluctuations themselves have rapidly decaying correlations, the magnitude of fluctuations measured by either the absolute value or the square of the price fluctuations has correlations that decay as a power-law, persisting for several months. (iii) Volatility and trading activity: We quantify the relation between trading activity - measured by the number of transactions N??t - and the price change G??t for a given stock, over a time interval [t,t+??t]. We find that N??t displays long-range power-law correlations in time, which leads to the interpretation that the long-range correlations previously found for |G??t| are connected to those of N??t.",

				"abstract": "HE three possible hypotheses with respect to what an investor pays for when he ac-quires a share of common stock are that he is buying (i) both the dividends and the earnings, (2) the dividends, and (3) the earnings. It may be argued that most commonly he is buying the price at some future date, but if the future price will be related to the expected dividends and/or earnings on that date, we need not go beyond the three hypotheses stated. This paper will critically evaluate the hypotheses by deriving the relation among the variables that follows from each hypothesis and then testing the the-ories with cross-section sample data. That is, price, dividend, and earnings data for a sample of corporations as of a point in time will be used to test the relation among the variables predict-ed by each hypothesis. The variation in price among common stocks is of considerable interest for the discovery of profitable investment opportunities, for the guid-ance of corporate financial policy, and for the understanding of the psychology of investment behavior.' Although one would expect that this interest would find expression in cross-section statistical studies, a search of the literature is unrewarding. Cross-section studies of a sort are used ex-tensively by security analysts to arrive at buy and sell recommendations. The values of certain attributes such as the dividend yield, growth in sales, and management ability are obtained and compared for two or more stocks. Then, by some weighting process, a conclusion is reached from this information that a stock is or is not an attractive buy at its current price.2 Graham and Dodd go so far as to state that stock prices should bear a specified relation to earnings and dividends, but they neither present nor cite data to support the generalization.3 The distin-guished theoretical book on investment value by J. B. Williams contains several chapters de-voted to the application of the theory, but his empirical work is in the tradition of the invest-ment analyst's approach.4 The only study along the lines suggested here that is known to the writer is a recent one on bank stocks by David Durand.5 In contrast with the dearth of published stud-ies the writer has encountered a number of unpublished cross-section regressions of stock prices on dividends, earnings, and sometimes other variables. In these the correlations were high, but the values of the regression coefficients and their variation among samples (different industries or different years) made the eco-nomic significance of the results so questionable that the investigators were persuaded to aban-don their studies. There is reason to believe that the unsatisfactory nature of the findings is due in large measure to the inadequacy of the theory employed in interpreting the model, and it is hoped that this paper will contribute to a more effective use of cross-section stock price studies by presenting what might be called the elementary theory of the variation in stock prices with dividends and earnings. Before proceeding, it may be noted that there have been some time series studies of the varia-tion in stock prices with dividends and other variables. The focus of these studies has been the relation between the stock market and the business cycle6 and the discovery of profitable * The research for this paper was supported by the Sloan Research Fund of the School of Industrial Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The author has benefited from the advice of Professors Edwin Kuh, Eli Shapiro, and Gregory Chow. The computations were done in part at the M.I.T. Computation Center. 'Assume that the hypothesis stock price, P f (xi, X2,...), is stated so that it can be tested, and it is found to do a good job of explaining the variation in price among stocks. The model and its coefficients thereby shed light on what investors consider and the weight they give these variables in buying common stocks. This information is valuable to corporations insofar as the prices of their stocks influence their financial plans. It is also true that a stock selling at a price above or below that predicted by the model deserves special consideration by investors.",

Therefore, their detection and correction should be taken seriously when modeling financial data. The present paper focuses on these issues and proposes a general detection and correction method based on wavelets that can be applied to a large class of volatility models. The effectiveness of the new proposal is tested by an intensive Monte Carlo study for six well-known volatility models and compared to alternative proposals in the literature, before it is applied to three daily stock market indices. The Monte Carlo experiments show that the new method is both very effective in detecting isolated outliers and outlier patches and much more reliable than other alternatives, since it detects a significantly smaller number of false outliers. Correcting the data of outliers reduces the skewness and the excess kurtosis of the return series distributions and allows for more accurate return prediction intervals compared to those obtained when the existence of outliers is ignored. textcopyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We formulate the necessary conditions based on the Hloc behavior which have to be satisfied if the rupture or crash point is expected soon. As a result we show that the signal to sell or the signal to buy on the stock exchange market can be translated into Hloc evolution pattern. We also find a relation between the rate of the Hloc drop and the total correction the WIG index gains after the crash.

				"abstract": "Analysis of financial time series with,a view to understanding its underlying characteristic features has been the recent focus of scientists and practitioners studying the financial market. One of the key attributes of a time series is its periodicity. Because of their quasi-periodic nature, the financial time series do not reveal their periodicity clearly. One of the recent developments in time signal analysis is the Hilbert-Huang empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, which elegantly brings out the underlying periodicity of any time-series. Not many efforts have been made to utilise this technique in qualitative analysis of financial time series. In the present study, we have used the EMD technique to analyse two different financial time series, viz., the daily movement of NIFTY index value of National Stock Exchange, India, and that of Hong Kong AOI, Hong Kong Stock Exchange from July 1990 to January 2006. The returns of the two indices are shown to have strikingly similar probability distribution. The IMF phase and amplitude probability distribution of the two indices also reveal striking similarity. This indicates a remarkable similarity of trading behaviour in the two markets. Considering the geographical and political separation of the two, this indeed is an important discovery. ?? 2006.",

				"abstract": "Predicting the stock market has become an increasingly interesting research area for both researchers and investors, and many prediction models have been proposed. In these models, feature selection techniques are used to pre-process the raw data and remove noise. In this paper, a prediction model is constructed to forecast stock market behavior with the aid of independent component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and a support vector machine. First, two types of features are extracted from the historical closing prices and 39 technical variables obtained by independent component analysis. Second, a canonical correlation analysis method is utilized to combine the two types of features and extract intrinsic features to improve the performance of the prediction model. Finally, a support vector machine is applied to forecast the next day's closing price. The proposed model is applied to the Shanghai stock market index and the Dow Jones index, and experimental results show that the proposed model performs better in the area of prediction than other two similar models.",

				"abstract": "We discuss the theoretical machinery involved in predicting financial market movements using an artificial market model which has been trained on real financial data. This approach to market prediction - in particular, forecasting financial time-series by training a third-party or 'black box' game on the financial data itself -- was discussed by Johnson et al. in cond-mat/0105303 and cond-mat/0105258 and was based on some encouraging preliminary investigations of the dollar-yen exchange rate, various individual stocks, and stock market indices. However, the initial attempts lacked a clear formal methodology. Here we present a detailed methodology, using optimization techniques to build an estimate of the strategy distribution across the multi-trader population. In contrast to earlier attempts, we are able to present a systematic method for identifying 'pockets of predictability' in real-world markets. We find that as each pocket closes up, the black-box system needs to be 'reset' - which is equivalent to saying that the current probability estimates of the strategy allocation across the multi-trader population are no longer accurate. Instead, new probability estimates need to be obtained by iterative updating, until a new 'pocket of predictability' emerges and reliable prediction can resume.",

				"abstract": "Stock price forecasting has been mostly realized using quantitative information. However, recent studies have demonstrated that sentiment information hidden in corporate annual reports can be successfully used to predict short-run stock price returns. Soft computing methods, like neural networks and support vector regression, have shown promising results in the forecasting of stock price due to their ability to model complex non-linear systems. In this paper, we apply several neural networks and $epsilon$-support vector regression models to predict the yearly change in the stock price of U.S. firms. We demonstrate that neural networks and $epsilon$-support vector regression perform better than linear regression models especially when using the sentiment information. The change in the sentiment of annual reports seems to be an important determinant of long-run stock price change. Concretely, the negative and uncertainty categories of terms were the key factors of the stock price return. Profitability and technical analysis ratios have significant effect on the long-run return, too.",

Results show that changes in expected inflation explain a large share of the time series variation of the mispricing component of the dividend yield. Also, while both inflation hedging and inflation illusion effects exist for REITs, the inflation illusion effect tends to dominate the hedging effect during the 1980 to 2008 period. These results suggest that investors are unable to quickly reconcile changes in discount rates and dividend growth rates associated with inflation into stock prices. The findings also provide an alternative explanation as to why short-term REIT returns are often negatively related to expected inflation.",

For REITs, with the move from discrete to decimal pricing, the price drop on the ex-dividend day approaches the dividend amount, the ex-date abnormal return decreases, the spread-to-dividend ratio declines, abnormal trading volume increases, and the potential erroneous appearance of a tax-clientele effect is diminished. Discreteness and other transaction costs are reduced with decimalization implying that part of the persistence in the appearance of the tax-clientele effect when modeling ex-dividend stock pricing might be generated by the interaction between transaction costs, dividend amount, and yield.

The test is based on the LM, or score, principle and is derived under the assumption that the time dimension of the panel is fixed, which is typical in many panel data studies. It is shown that the limiting distribution of the test statistic is standard normal. The similarity of the test with respect to both the initial conditions of the panel and the fixed effects is achieved by allowing for a trend in the model using a parameterisation that has the same interpretation under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This parameterisation can be expected to increase the power of the test statistic. Simulation evidence suggests that the proposed test has empirical size that is very close to the nominal level and considerably more power than other panel unit root tests that assume that the time dimension of the panel is large. As an application of the test, we re-examine the stationarity of real stock prices and dividends using disaggregated panel data over a relatively short period of time. Our results suggest that while real stock prices contain a unit root, real dividends are trend stationary. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

The current literature in financial economics offers differing opininon on each of these relationship. This research addresses a significant aspect of this debate by examining the direction of causality between the money supply, stock prices and interest rates. Using Granger-Sims' test for determining unidirectional causality, we find that the relationship between the money supply and stock prices is characterized by a feedback system, with money supply causing some of the observed variations in the stock price levels and vice versa. With respect to the relationship between stock prices and interest rates, the results are not as conclusive. In this instance, the causality seems to be mostly running from interest rates to stock prices, and not the other way around.",

				"abstract": "This paper analyzes the co-movement of the exchange rates and the stock prices from the viewpoint of contagion among the eight countries in the region during the period of Asian currency crisis, 1997-1999. Ito and Hashimoto (2002; NBER working paper) proposed a new definition of high-frequency contagion using daily exchange rate data. This paper extends the idea to include the stock market origins that are separately identified for the exchange rate and the stock price. Then contagion is defined not only among the exchange rates and stock prices separately, but also between an exchange rate and a stock price of the same country or of different countries. One of the motivations is the following observation. Hong Kong successfully defended the peg to the U.S. dollar throughout the Asian currency crisis period. However, the Hong Kong stock market was affected by the decline in currencies of neighboring countries most notably in October 1997. We use a friction model and a Tobit model to analyze the impact of a negative shock in one asset price to others. The difference between mildly-affected countries and severely-affected countries is analyzed; categories of large declines in the exchange rates (or stock prices) are made differentiated; and whether the stock prices were increasing or decreasing is distinguished. It is found, among others, that there was, in general the contagion between the exchange rates and stock prices; that the stock prices in Hong Kong were found to suffer from contagious effects from the decline in the Asian currencies; and that Indonesian, Korean and Thai currency depreciation and Hong Kong stock price declines had impacts on other currencies and stock prices in the region during the crisis period.",

It examines a possible causal relation between these variables in a vector autoregression (VAR) model. The results show that Granger causality is unidirectional running from stock prices to effective exchange rates. The results also reveal that an increase in Swedish stock prices is associated with an appreciation of the Swedish krona. Special attention is given to the estimation methodology and the lag choosing process.",

				"abstract": "This study investigates the impact of foreign investors on the informational efficiency of stock prices in local markets. Using a large sample of Japanese firms over the period 1976 to 2008, we find that prices deviate less from a random walk for stocks with a large change in foreign ownership. This relation is robust to controls for local institutional ownership, stock liquidity, and firm fixed effects. Granger causality tests show that changes in foreign investor trading predict changes in price efficiency in the next period, but not vice versa. Finally, we use a quasi-natural experiment to show that an increase in foreign ownership causes an improvement in price efficiency. Collectively, these results suggest that foreign investors improve price efficiency in local stock markets. textcopyright 2014.",

				"abstract": "The existence of nonlinear structures in the mean equation leads some authors [43, 44] to model financial time series by a Mackey-Glass equation, which is a differential equation with delay. We propose, in this paper, to compare the contributions of the [52]'s equation in the modelling of nonlinear structures in the mean equation with that of [48], published the same year but which may lead to different results in finance. Theoretical results point out that these two equations can describe mean dynamics' of financial time series. These dynamics reflect the interaction between two types of agents, fundamentalists and chartists, that creates chaotic structures. To verify this, we apply these two models to two Europeans stock markets indices [CAC 40 and DAX 30] on the period [2003-2011]. We show the adequacy of these models, associated with a GARCH specification, to financial time series, com- paratively to the ARMA-GARCH model. Moreover, it seems that the [48]'s model is more suitable than the [52]'s model for strongly leptokurtic financial time series: these findings are based on the backtesting results' conducted on VaR forecasts'.

A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other time-varying copula methods.",

The tax structure in Finland is strikingly similar to the new tax structure in the U.S. which was for the first time in effect during the fiscal year 1987. The results in this paper may thus also illuminate the ex-dividend day behaviour in the U.S. stock markets under the new tax law. Our empirical data show that the average drop in the stock prices on their ex-dividend days has been 90% of the amount of the dividend during the years of 1974 to 1985. This is shown to be consistent with the tax explanation taking into account the Finnish tax laws. It is especially shown that the marginal seller on the ex-dividend days is an individual investor with a marginal tax rate of approximately 50%. textcopyright 1990.",

				"abstract": "While SFAS No. 131 is intended to increase the transparency of financial reporting using a “management approach,” it may reduce shareholders' ability to interpret segment disclosures relative to the ‘industry approach' employed under SFAS No.14. This study investigates whether segment reconciliation differences affect stock prices and whether abnormal returns can be earned using information about two components of earnings: aggregated segment earnings and segment earnings reconciliations. We compute reconciliations as the difference between firm-level consolidated earnings and aggregated segment-level earnings. Firms that report negative SERs have greater sales and profitability, greater return on equity, as well as more operating cash flows and firm growth. This suggests that firms that report aggregated segment earnings greater than firm-level consolidated earnings may be better off financially. Our findings show that mispricing does occur when firms report positive SERs by the market, underestimating the segment earnings reconciliation component of earnings persistence. Investors can also earn positive abnormal returns when investors take a long (short) position with the portfolio with the highest (lowest) absolute SERs. On the contrary, we find investors earn negative abnormal returns when firms report negative SERs. Collectively, this study provides evidence that mispricing occurs and that investors over/underestimate the importance and/or persistence of segment earnings reconciliations.",

				"abstract": "Negotiation and trade typically require a mutual interaction while simultaneously resting in uncertainty which decision the partner ultimately will make at the end of the process. Assessing already during the negotiation in which direction one's counterpart tends would provide a tremendous advantage. Recently, neuroimaging techniques combined with multivariate pattern classification of the acquired data have made it possible to discriminate subjective states of mind on the basis of their neuronal activation signature. However, to enable an online-assessment of the participant's mind state both approaches need to be extended to a real-time technique. By combining real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and online pattern classification techniques, we show that it is possible to predict human behavior during social interaction before the interacting partner communicates a specific decision. Average accuracy reached approximately 70% when we predicted online the decisions of volunteers playing the ultimatum game, a well-known paradigm in economic game theory. Our results demonstrate the successful online analysis of complex emotional and cognitive states using real-time fMRI, which will enable a major breakthrough for social fMRI by providing information about mental states of partners already during the mutual interaction. Interestingly, an additional whole brain classification across subjects confirmed the online results: anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, known to act in emotional self-regulation and reward processing for adjustment of behavior, appeared to be strong determinants of later overt behavior in the ultimatum game. Using whole brain classification we were also able to discriminate between brain processes related to subjective emotional and motivational states and brain processes related to the evaluation of objective financial incentives.",

				"abstract": "In this paper, I find that the imbalance between buy and sell orders explains most of the stock price changes. I then show that this effect is driven largely by uninformed price pressure, and not only by private information. To obtain that result, I first establish that causality goes from orders to price. I then distinguish between private information and uninformed price pressure by looking at the implications of a private information model. For idiosyncratic returns, where one would expect private information to be important and the R(2) of return on order flow to be high, the R(2) is indeed around 41%. However, for the common market return, where one would expect private information to be minor, the R(2) is even higher at 70%. This argues against private information and in favor of uninformed price pressure. Moreover, the 70% of the market return that is generated by the order flow imbalance is too high not to include some transitory components of the market return, as defined in the literature on long-term mean reversion. This means that the order flow temporarily moves stock prices away from their fundamental value. This paper points toward a bigger role for uninformed price pressure than is usually assumed.",

				"abstract": "Steel making is an energy intensive industry and for this reason, energy prices, especially oil and natural gas prices, have an important effect on this industry. In 2008, the sharp rise of crude oil as well as iron ore price caused the sharp rise of steel price because of the rise in prices of key production factors. But Iran's producers experienced almost no rise in their production factor prices especially key factors of energy and iron ore prices. As a matter of fact, inexpensive energy and iron ore are competitive advantages of steel makers in Iran because the huge natural resources of the country let the government to$backslash$nprovide inexpensive production factors for the industry. But these inexpensive factors have some side effects that one of them is on the stock price of steel makers in stock market.$backslash$n$backslash$nIn this paper we are to model the effects of fluctuations in world steel price on stock price of one of Iranian steel producers. In the end, we will offer some policies to mitigate the fluctuations of stock prices.",

This paper designs a general state space model to investigate the importance of a common world-wide component and the existence of country-specific components in national stock market indices. For G7 countries, there exist country-specific permanent and transitory components. Based on a variance decomposition analysis, Germany, Italy, and Japan's country-specific permanent shocks account for about half of their total permanent shocks. Most of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom's transitory shocks are country-specific. G7 countries do not seem to cointegrate around one common stochastic trend, and potential long-run international diversification benefits still exist. textcopyright 2006 Elsevier B.V.

				"abstract": "A new method, the Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT), developed initially for natural and engineering sciences has now been applied to financial data. The HHT method is specially developed for analysing non- linear and non-stationary data. The method consists of two parts: (1) the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and (2) the Hilbert spectral analysis. The key part of the method is the first step, the EMD, with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). An IMF is defined here as any function having the same number of zero-crossing and extrema, and also having symmetric envelopes defined by the local maxima, and minima respectively. The IMF also thus admits well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to non-linear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the IMF yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy–frequency–time distribution, which we designate as the Hilbert Spectrum. Comparisons with Wavelet and Fourier analyses show the new method offers much better temporal and frequency resolutions. The EMD is also useful as a filter to extract variability of different scales. In the present application, HHT has been used to examine the changeability of the market, as a measure of volatility of the market. Published",

				"abstract": "Existing research suggests that market misvaluations affect corporate investment, often leading to suboptimal investment. I examine whether earnings smoothness reduces the impact of market valuations on corporate investment and in turn enhances investment efficiency. I find that earnings smoothness has a strong negative effect on the sensitivity of corporate investment to stock prices. Further analyses indicate that this negative effect is driven by both innate and discretionary components of earnings smoothness and is more pronounced for firms operating in more volatile business environments. I complement these findings by demonstrating that firms with smoother earnings have lower over- (under-)investment and higher future operating performance. Collectively, the evidence suggests that earnings smoothness improves corporate investment efficiency by reducing the impact of market valuations on investment.",

				"abstract": "We introduce a variant of the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard stochastic volatility model where the non Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process describes some measure of trading intensity like trading volume or number of trades instead of unobservable instantaneous variance. We develop an explicit estimator based on martingale estimating functions in a bivariate model that is not a diffusion, but admits jumps. It is assumed that both the quantities are observed on a discrete grid of fixed width, and the observation horizon tends to infinity. We show that the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal and give explicit expressions of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Our method is illustrated by a finite sample experiment and a statistical analysis on the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) stock from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock from Nasdaq during a history of five years.",

In construction of GMRVV-SVR, the common grey model with revised verge value (GMRVV) has been introduced and modified by support vector regression based on the calculation of the residual error sequence between predicted values and original data. Since the recent data points could provide more information than distant data points, more importance has been attached to the punishment parameter C of recent data points in support vector regression. Simultaneously, the parameter epsiv in epsiv-insensitive loss function has been determined according to smoothing overshooting. Pattern search (PS) algorithm has been adopted to tune free parameters. A real experimental result shows that the composite model can achieve comparative accurate prediction as well as smoothing overshooting in financial time series prediction.",

				"abstract": "Firms can change their outstanding shares to manage their stock price levels. Those with lower stock prices tend to attract more speculative trading, which causes higher price volatility and may force their managers to excessively focus on short-term earnings at the expense of R&D and other long-term projects. Thus, we hypothesize that firms investing more in R&D prefer to set higher stock prices to mitigate investor short-termism and foster innovation. Indeed, we find that firms with more R&D capital tend to keep higher stock prices and are less likely to split their stocks to lower prices. Furthermore, highpriced firms are less likely to cut R&D to reverse an earnings decline, and less likely to fire their CEOs in the presence of poor earnings. More importantly, firms' R&D productivity—in terms of generating patents and patent citations—tends to increase with their stock prices, even after controlling for firm valuation, stock returns, stock liquidity, and institutional ownership. For robustness checks, we examine stock splits, which allow mangers to re-set their stock price levels, and IPOs in which managers set an offering price range before shares are publicly traded. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that IPO firms setting higher offering prices have more future innovation and that innovation declines after firms split their stocks. Thus, our results imply that managers of R&D firms actively set high stock prices to foster innovation, and support Warren Buffett's wisdom that firms can use stock prices to attract preferred clientele.",

The polynomial pipelined neural network is used to predict the exchange rate between the US dollar and three other currencies. In this application, two sets of experiments are carried out. In the first set, the input data are pre-processed between 0 and 1 and passed to the neural networks as nonstationary data. In the second set of experiments, the nonstationary input signals are transformed into one step relative increase in price. The network demonstrates more accurate forecasting and an improvement in the signal to noise ratio over a number of benchmarked neural networks. textcopyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results strongly suggest informational inefficiency in the Malaysian market. The bivariate analysis suggests cointegration between the stock prices and three macroeconomic variables - consumer prices, credit aggregates and official reserves. From bivariate error-correction models, we note the reactions of the stock prices to deviations from the long run equilibrium. These results are further strengthened when we extend the analysis to multivariate settings. We also note some evidence that the stock prices are Granger-caused by changes in the official reserves and exchange rates in the short run.",

We find evidence for lack of cointegration among the Indonesian market, other ASEAN markets (Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) and two advanced markets (the US and Japan) during both pre‐crisis and post‐crisis periods. Looking at short run dynamics, we document evidence for substantial interactions among the ASEAN markets. However, it seems that the Indonesian market becomes more segmented from other ASEAN markets during the post‐crisis period. Additionally, while most ASEAN markets respond quickly to shocks in the US regardless of the sample period and seem to be less influenced by the Japanese market post crisis, the Indonesian market becomes more responsive to the developed markets of the US and Japan during the post crisis period.",

We find evidence that hank loans react positively to the increase in stock prices but there seems to be no influence from hank loans to stock prices. Similarly, bank loans seem to accommodate expansion in real output with, again, no influence of bank loans on real economic activity. Interestingly, despite the noted currency mismatch of bank assets and liabilities as a factor that aggravates the currency crisis, we find no evidence that the exchange rate fluctuations have impact on bank lending. If anything, the exchange rate seems to affect bank lending activities through its effects on real output and stock prices. From the dynamic responses, we tend to conclude that bank loans play no significant role in transmitting stock market shocks to the real sector. An important implication from our analysis is that the health of the banking sector depends crucially on stock market stability and real output stability. Additionally, policy attempts to stimulate bank loans as a way to boost stock market activities as well as to expand real activities maybe futile.",

These bubbles exhibit various transition patterns, such as nonmonotonic movements and monotonic shrinkage in magnitude and volatility.

We demonstrate by using two models for dividend-paying and nondividend-paying stocks that as price volatility rises, the RMSE of the random walk rises, but the RMSE of the model rises even more rapidly, making it unlikely for the model to outperform the random walk.",

				"abstract": "textlessptextgreaterThis paper presents a subband approach to financial time series prediction. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) is employed here for multiband representation of multichannel financial time series together. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is used in prediction of individual subband of any time series data. Then all the predicted subband signals are summed up to obtain the overall prediction. The ARMA model works better for stationary signal. With multiband representation, each subband becomes a band-limited (narrow band) signal and hence better prediction is achieved. The performance of the proposed MEMD-ARMA model is compared with classical EMD, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and with full band ARMA model in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean square error (MSE) between the original and predicted time series. The simulation results show that the MEMD-ARMA-based method performs better than the other methods.textless/ptextgreater",

This research considers high-frequency data of USD-MYR exchange rates and Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLSE) from July 22, 2005 to March 23, 2007, which is the period when the MYR was unpegged. The Johansen cointegration method suggests that there is no long-run equilibrium relationship between these two financial variables. Both Engle Granger and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests find that there is uni-directional causality running from stock prices to exchange rates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

However, FPCA assumes each sample curve is drawn from an independent and identical distribution. This assumption is axiomatically inconsistent with financial data; rather, samples are often interlinked by an underlying temporal dynamical process. We present a new modeling approach using Vector auto-regression (VAR) to drive the weights of the principal components. In this novel process, the temporal dynamics are first learned and then the principal components extracted. We dub this method the VAR-FPCA. We apply our method to the NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures curves and demonstrate that it contains significant advantages over the conventional FPCA in applications such as statistical arbitrage and risk management.",

				"abstract": "Articles in the financial press suggest that institutional investors are overly focused on current profitability, which suggests that as institutional ownership increases, stock prices reflect less current period information that is predictive of future period earnings. On the other hand, institutional investors are often characterized in academic research as sophisticated investors and sophisticated investors should be better able to use current-period information to predict future earnings compared with other owners. According to this characterization, as institutional ownership increases, stock prices should reflect more current-period information that is predictive of future period earnings. Consistent with this latter view, we find that the extent to which stock prices lead earnings is positively related to the percentage of institutional ownership. This result holds after controlling for various factors that affect the relation between price and earnings. It also holds when we control for endogenous portfolio choices of institutions (e.g., institutional investors may be attracted to firms in richer information environments where stock prices tend to lead earnings). Further, a regression of stock returns on order backlog, conditional on the percentage of institutional ownership, indicates that institutional owners place more weight on order backlog compared with other owners. This result is consistent with institutional owners using non-earnings information to predict future earnings. It also explains, in part, why prices lead earnings to a greater extent when there is a higher concentration of institutional owners.",

In order to construct GMRVVm-SVR, the m-root grey model with revised verge value (GMRVVm) has been introduced and modified by support vector regression based on the calculation of the residual error sequence between predicted values and original data. Due to the recent data points providing more information than distant data points, more importance has been attached to the punishment parameter C of recent data points in support vector regression. Simultaneously, the parameter e in e-insensitive loss function has been determined according to smoothing overshooting. Pattern search (PS) algorithm has been carried out to tune free parameters. A real experimental result shows that the complex model can achieve comparative accurate prediction as well as smoothing overshooting in financial time series prediction. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

				"abstract": "n this paper we propose a revised version of (bagging) bootstrap aggregating as a forecast combination method for the out-of-sample forecasts in time series models. The revised version explicitly takes into account the dependence in time series data and can be used to justify the validity of bagging in the reduction of mean squared forecast error when compared with the unbagged forecasts. Monte Carlo simulations show that the new method works quite well and outperforms the traditional one-step-ahead linear forecast as well as the nonparametric forecast in general, especially when the in-sample estimation period is small. We also find that the bagging forecasts based on misspecified linear models may work as effectively as those based on nonparametric models, suggesting the robustification property of bagging method in terms of out-of-sample forecasts. We then reexamine forecasting powers of predictive variables suggested in the literature to forecast the excess returns or equity premium. We find that, consistent with Goyal and Welch (2008), the historical average excess stock return forecasts may beat other predictor variables in the literature when we apply traditional one-step linear forecast and the nonparametric forecasting methods. However, when using the bagging method or its revised version, which help to improve the mean squared forecast error for “unstable” predictors, the predictive variables have a better forecasting power than the historical mean.

With the help of Campbell's coding theorem, we show that the Renyi entropy selectively emphasizes only certain sectors of the underlying empirical distribution while strongly suppressing others. This accentuation is controlled with Renyi's parameter q. To tackle the issue of the information flow between time series, we formulate the concept of Renyi's transfer entropy as a measure of information that is transferred only between certain parts of underlying distributions. This is particularly pertinent in financial time series, where the knowledge of marginal events such as spikes or sudden jumps is of a crucial importance. We apply the Renyian information flow to stock market time series from 11 world stock indices as sampled at a daily rate in the time period 02.01.1990-31.12.2009.

These companies are Hub co, Lucky Cement, Honda Atlas and Nishat Mills. The research is conducted by gathering five year data (2004 to 2009) of related firms regarding their dividend payments and stock prices. The Time series graph and pivot graphs are plotted on data. The time series graph of stock prices of lucky Cement, Atlas Honda and Nishat Mills show variability of stock prices. Time series graph of dividend per share goes against the stock prices trend. Pivot Chart shows the comparison of stock prices and dividend per share of individual company. The findings indicate that the stock prices of all sample companies change with the change in dividends per share. The correlation results show that there is strong positive or negative relationship has been found between stock prices and dividends per share. It is evident that most of the stock prices have negative correlation with the dividend per share. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

				"abstract": "Literature suggests that dividend payments should have no impact on shareholders value in the absence of taxes and market imperfections. Companies should invest surplus funds in the projects having positive net present value instead of paying out as dividend. Literature also suggests that market valuation of stocks depends on the expected future dividends. Despite these theoretical arguments for not paying dividends, companies often pay dividends to their shareholders possibly to signal out information about the future earning prospects. Our empirical study based on 24 dividend paying companies listed at the Lahore Stock Exchange (LSE). The companies are selected on the bases of the higher stock turnover. The results showed that the investors did not gain value from dividend announcement. Indeed, shareholders lost some value over a period of one month prior to the dividend announcement through seven days after ex-dividend date. Overall, the evidence tends to support the dividend irrelevancy hypothesis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

				"abstract": "Visual data analysis of time related data sets has attracted much research interest recently, and a number of sophisticated visualization methods have been proposed in the past. In financial analysis, however, the most important and most common visualization techniques for time series data is the traditional line- or bar chart. Although these are intuitive and make it easy to spot the effect of key events on a assets price, and its return over a given period of time, price charts do not allow the easy perception of relative movements in terms of growth rates, which is the key feature of any price-related time series. This paper presents a novel Growth Matrix visualization technique for analyzing assets. It extends the ability of existing chart techniques by not only visualizing asset return rates over fixed time frames, but over the full spectrum of all subintervals present in a given time frame, in a single view. At the same time, the technique allows a comparison of subinterval return rates among groups of even a few hundreds of assets. This provides a powerful way for analyzing financial data, since it allows the identification of strong and weak periods of assets as compared to global market characteristics, and thus allows a more encompassing visual classification into \"good\" and \"poor\" performers than existing chart techniques. We illustrate the technique by real-world examples showing the abilities of the new approach, and its high relevance for financial analysis tasks.",

It assumes that individual probability of being a noise trader is diminishing in income: high-income households are smart money, lower-income households are noise traders, with passive investors in between. Market data behave as predicted: high participation by the general population is a negative predictor of one-year returns, and is associated with low participation by very high-income groups. The implications for the equity premium puzzle of the low returns earned by noise traders are discussed.",

In order to check the stationarity of time-series data Augmented Dickey Fuller test (Dickey and Fuller, 1981), Phillips-Perron test (Phillips and Perron, 1988) unit root test has been applied. Co-integration, Vector Error Correction Model and variance decomposition has been applied to check long and short term relationship between the variables. Whereas Ordinary least square test has been applied to test the co linearity between the variables. Results indicate that all variables except money supply have significant impact on stock returns in Pakistan.",

Two key problems in. financial time series forecasting are noise and non-stationarity. Here, we assign a higher membership value to data samples that contain more relevant information, where relevance is related to recency in time. The approach requires only a single matrix inversion. For the linear case, the matrix order depends only on the dimension in which the data samples lie, and is independent of the number of samples. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on. financial datasets available in the public domain. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "This paper re-evaluates the key past results of unit root test, emphasizing that the use of a conventional level of significance is not in general optimal due to the test having low power. The optimal levels for popular unit root tests, chosen using the line of enlightened judgement under a symmetric loss function, are found to be much higher than conventional ones. We also propose simple calibration rules for the optimal level of significance for a range of unit root tests based on asymptotic local power. At the optimal levels, many time series in the extended Nelson-Plosser data set are judged to be trend-stationary, including real income variables, employment variables and money stock. We also find nearly all real exchange rates covered in the Elliott-Pesavento study to be stationary at the optimal levels, which lends strong support for the purchasing power parity. Additionally, most of the real interest rates covered in the Rapach-Weber study are found to be stationary.",

Comparison of data before and after World War II shows that mean reversion is entirely a pre-war phenomenon. Using randomization methods to calculate significance levels, we find that the full sample evidence for mean reversion is weaker than previously indicated by Monte Carlo methods under a Normal assumption. Further, the switch to mean-averting behaviour after the war is about to be too strong to be compatible with sampling variation. We interpret these findings as evidence of a fundamental change in the stock returns process and conjecture that it may be due to the resolution of the uncertainties of the 1930's and 1940's.",

This coincided with a change in the regulatory environment that encouraged banking institutions topay more attention to their capitalpositions.

The essence of these models is that the forecasts and thus the desired trades of the individuals in the markets are influenced, directly or indirectly, by those of the other participants. These \"field effects\" generate \"herding\" behavior that affects the structure of the asset price dynamics. The series of returns generated by these models display the same empirical properties as financial returns: returns are I (0), the series of absolute and squared returns display strong dependence, and the series of absolute returns do not display a trend. Furthermore, this class of models is able to replicate the common long-memory properties in the volatility and covolatility of financial time series revealed by Teyssière (1997, 1998a). These properties are investigated by using various model-independent tests and estimators, that is, semiparametric and nonparametric, introduced by Lo (1991), Kwiatkowski et al. (1992), Robinson (1995), Lobato and Robinson (1998), and Giraitis et al. (2000, forthcoming).

We further develop statistics based on OHLC data, which separately measure upside and downside overreaction. The distribution of these statistics under the hypothesis of correct response and fundamental prices following Brownian motions is used to derive tests for upside and downside overreaction. We show that more realistic and frequently used fundamental price processes with correct response leave the distribution of the test statistics widely unaffected or lead to conservative tests. Empirical application to different stock markets provides strong evidence for intraday overreaction, particularly to bad news. The economic significance of the discrimination induced by the proposed statistics is further illustrated by analyzing the performance of a simple buy on bad news strategy. textcopyright 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

It differs from previous work in two ways: (1) changes in stock prices, rather than accounting data, are used to measure profitability effects; and (2) emphasis is placed on changes in reserve requirements, as opposed to their level. Regarding the latter distinction, two kinds of changes are considered: (1) temporary changes in reserve requirements for the purpose of discretionary monetary policy, and (2) more permanent changes in reserve requirement levels. Based on the event-study methodology, temporary changes were found to have little effect on security prices, whereas more permanent changes had a stronger influence on bank stock prices, reflecting a tax burden effect. textcopyright 1988.",

				"abstract": "Purpose ? The purpose of this paper is to explore the relations of investment and stock prices (Tobin?Q), the impact of asymmetric information on the investment sensitivity to stock price, and the impact of asymmetric information on the stock price sensitivity to investment.Design/methodology/approach ? Research was conducted with 313 listed companies and 1,878 firm?year observations from Chinese stock market. Empirical studies were conducted based on two hypotheses by using R2, information delay and scores of information disclosure as measures of asymmetric information and taking changes in book assets and capital expenditures scaled by book assets as measures of investment.Findings ? The key findings of the paper are: managers are learning from the market when they make investment decisions; the asymmetric information has a significant negative impact on the investment sensitivity to stock price; and the asymmetric information has a significant positive impact on the stock price sensitivity to investment.Practical implications ? The paper has a significant practical implication for regulation policy making in stock market.Originality/value ? The paper fills the research gap in two points. It studies the impact of asymmetric information on the investment sensitivity to stock price, and the impact of asymmetric information on the stock price sensitivity to investment in Chinese stock market for the first time.",

First, by using monthly data for 16 industrialized countries for the period 1973–2011 we find evidence of time-varying cointegration relationship between effective exchange rates and national stock market indices. Second, we present that the cointegration relationship affects exchange rate exposure. We propose that the exchange rate exposure effect changes when the connection between the exchange rate and stock market emerges. This is a new result and reflects importance of these markets' joint role in international risk sharing.textless/ptextgreater",

				"abstract": "From an information perspective, sources of risk should be reflected in accounting fundamentals. However, asymmetry in disclosure generated from a decrease in information flow to users of financial statements may lead to a stock price crash when the news is eventually disclosed. The present study examines the impact of a number of accounting and auditing attributes that have been found to improve reporting efficiency on the prediction of stock price crash risk. The results indicate a negative relation between conditional conservatism and future stock price crash risk, which supports evidence in the existing literature but more importantly provide new evidence by showing that unconditional conservatism is also negatively related to future stock price crash risk. In addition some evidence shows that the level of unconditional conservatism affects the relation between conditional conservatism and future stock price crash risk. On the other hand, auditing attributes do not seem to have predictive ability for stock price crash risk while in consistency with the literature the relation between lagged earnings opacity and stock price crash risk is positive. Taken together, the results imply that researchers should disentangle the effects of the two forms of conservatism when assessing the likelihood of a future stock price crash and that the beneficial role of conservatism in reducing stock-crash risk should be not overlooked.",

Indeed, the results help to explain the poor forecasting ability of the recent econometric evidence used to explain common stock prices. It appears that further econometric studies of stock prices must seek out new determinants of stock prices if these studies are to forecast variations in stock prices based on changes in significant causal variables. On the other hand, if one believes markets are efficient, then any attempts to explain stock prices based on current and past information will be fruitless. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

				"abstract": "A common observation among economists on many economic time-series, including major financial time-series, is the asymmetrical movement between the downward phase and the upward phase of their sample paths. Since this feature of time irreversibility cannot be described by the Gaussian ARMA, ARIMA or ARCH time-series models, we propose stationary and non-stationary simultaneous switching autoregressive (SSAR) models, which are nonlinear switching time-series models. We discuss some properties of these time-series models and the estimation method for their unknown parameters. The asymmetrical conditional heteroscedasticity can be easily incorporated into the SSAR models. We also report a simple empirical result on Nikkei 225 Spot and Futures indices by using a non-stationary SSAR model. JEL Classification Numbers: C22, C32.",

				"abstract": "This paper presents a forecasting model that integrates the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) for predicting financial time series. The presented model first uses the DWT to decompose the financial time series data. Then, the obtained approximation (low-frequency) and detail (high-frequency) components after decomposition of the original time series are used as input variables to forecast future stock prices. Indeed, while high-frequency components can capture discontinuities, ruptures and singularities in the original data, low-frequency components characterize the coarse structure of the data, to identify the long-term trends in the original data. As a result, high-frequency components act as a complementary part of low-frequency components. The model was applied to seven datasets. For all of the datasets, accuracy measures showed that the presented model outperforms a conventional model that uses only low-frequency components. In addition, the presented model outperforms both the well-known auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) model and the random walk (RW) process.",

				"abstract": "Stock price predictions have always been a subject of interest for investors and professional analysts. Nevertheless, determining the best time to buy or sell a stock remains very difficult because there are many factors that may influence the stock prices. This paper establishes a novel financial time series-forecasting model by evolving and clustering fuzzy decision tree for stocks in Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC). This forecasting model integrates a data clustering technique, a fuzzy decision tree (FDT), and genetic algorithms (GA) to construct a decision-making system based on historical data and technical indexes. The set of historical data is divided into k sub-clusters by adopting K-means algorithm. GA is then applied to evolve the number of fuzzy terms for each input index in FDT so the forecasting accuracy of the model can be further improved. A different forecasting model will be generated for each sub-cluster. In other words, the number of fuzzy terms in each sub-cluster will be different. Hit rate is applied as a performance measure and the proposed GAFDT model has the best performance of 82% average hit rate when compared with other approaches on various stocks in TSEC.",

In the next decade oil companies will have to deal with international policies to contrast climate change. This issue is likely to affect companies' shareholder values. In this paper we focus on the long-run financial determinants of the stock prices of six major oil companies (Bp, Chevron-Texaco, Eni, Exxon-Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total-Fina-Elf) using multivariate cointegration techniques and vector error correction models. Weekly oil stock prices are analyzed together with the relevant stock market indexes, exchange rates, spot and future oil prices over the period January 1998-April 2003. The empirical results confirm the statistical significance of the major financial variables in explaining the long-run dynamics of oil companies' stock values. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

				"abstract": "This paper investigates the response of stock prices to dividend shocks in a bivariate model of stock prices and price-dividend spreads. Dividend process is modeled as the sum of a permanent component and a temporary component. By using the stock price valuation (present value) model, the two components are related to stock prices. The stock market responds significantly not only to permanent shocks to dividends, but also to temporary shocks to dividends. Furthermore, initial responses of stock prices to the temporary shocks are as strong as those to the permanent shocks. As a result, substantial variation in stock prices is due to the temporary shocks. This finding provides empirical support for the imperfect information hypothesis that emphasizes the failure of investors to clearly distinguish between the two components of dividends, and also suggests that the observed mean-reverting behavior of stock returns should be explained by incorporating a significant temporary component into stock prices. The price-dividend spreads are primarily accounted for by the temporary shocks to dividends, and respond strongly to them, suggesting that, in response to the temporary shocks to dividends, stock prices respond excessively relative to dividends.",

We employ a time-series framework of identifying tangible and intangible information based on two valuation models: the conventional dividend discount model and the residual income model. We find investors overreact to intangible information but underreact initially to tangible information, with no significant reversal associated with tangible information in the long run. Our finding is compatible with models incorporating investors' overconfidence in their private information. We also find that the residual income model provides a better valuation than the dividend discount model.",

The authors argue that claiming personal responsibility for negative events made the organizations appear more in control, leading to more positive impressions.",

				"abstract": "– We developed in this paper a method to predict time series with non-linear tools. The specificity of the method is to use as much information as possible as input to the model (many past values of the series, many exogenous variables), to compress this information (by a non-linear method) in order to obtain a state vector of limited size, facilitating the subsequent regression and the general-ization ability of the forecasting algorithm and to fit a non-linear regressor (here a RBF neural network) on the reduced vectors. We show that this method is able to find non-linear relationships in artificial and real-world financial series. On a diffi-cult task, which consists in forecasting the tendency of the Bel 20 stock market index, we show that this method improves the results compared both to linear models and to non-linear ones where the non-linear compression is not used.",

Both simulation study and empirical applications with the Heston stochastic volatility model indicate that in order to accurately capture the volatility dynamics, both stock prices and options are necessary. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is believed that news articles have impact on prices. Many approaches address this issue either from the documents&#x0A1;&#x0AF;sentiment point of view or from the word frequency point of view. In this paper, we propose a new model which captures the density of news articles and mines the latent relationship by employing information entropy to explore the news impact on the market. An empirical study is conducted to analyze market news articles&#x0A1;&#x0AF; impact on stock prices. We compare our results with the traditional model which is based on support vector machine (baseline). Experimental results show that our proposed news density model has a better performance on predicting relatively long term news impact.",

We find that these differences are largely driven by differences in financial market openness and hence different dynamic responses of monetary policy shocks between the two countries that we model in this paper.",

Meanwhile, on a per country and panel basis, the testing results using the DOLS approach match those of the short-run and long-run causal relations running from exchange rates to stock prices. These findings suggest that the monetary authorities for the ASEAN-5 should keep allowing their currency values of being determined by the economic fundamentals instead of interrupting them only in order to stimulate export growth unless a great deal of short-term speculative funds (hot money) flow into the currency markets. ?? 2013.",

The kernel function is modified using a conformal mapping to make the kernel data-dependent so as to increase the ability of predicting high noise data of the method. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Simulated results on the prediction of the stock price show that the improved approach possesses better forecasting precision and ability of generalization than the conventional models.",

				"abstract": "This is the first research to examine a potential relation between stock market volatility and mental disorders. Using data on daily incidences of mental disorders in Taiwan over 4000 days from 1998 through 2009 to assess the time-series relation between stock price movements and mental disorders, we observe that stock price fluctuation clearly affects the hospitalization of mental disorders. We find that during a 12-year follow-up period, a low stock price index, a daily fall in the stock price index and consecutive daily falls in the stock price index are all associated with greater of mental disorders hospitalizations. A 1000-point fall in the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) increases the number of daily mental disorders hospitalizations by 4.71%. A 1% fall in the TAIEX in one single day increases daily hospitalizations for mental disorders by 0.36%. When the stock price index falls one consecutive day, it causes a daily increase of approximately 0.32% hospitalizations due to mental disorders on that day. Stock price index is found to be significant for both gender and all age groups. In addition, daily change is significant for both gender and middle-age groups, whereas accumulated change is significant for males and people aged 45-64. Stockholdings can help people accumulate wealth, but they can also increase mental disorders hospitalizations. In other words, stock price fluctuations do drive people crazy.",

A number of individuals and institutions have onjected to such amendments on the grounds that they are not in the best interests of the shareholders of the firms that adopt them. This paper employs event-time methodology to investigate the impact of antitakeover amendments on the common stock prices of firms that adopt them. The results indicate that the announcement of such amendments is associated with a positive revaluation of stock price. Contrary to the concerns of their critics, we conclude that antitakeover amendments are proposed by managers who seek to increase the value of the firm and are approved by stockholders who share that objective. ?? 1983.",

				"abstract": "Many techniques have been used to predict financial time series data in order to make profitable transaction decisions. Conventional time series are usually identified as a global model. However, in the financial world, time series fluctuates rapidly in time, and so are difficult to be recognized by a single model. Therefore here, we propose a Hierarchical eXtended Classifier System (XCS) model, which is composed of multiple local models. Each local model represents an individual agent. In the lower levels of the hierarchy, agents are trained by the XCS method to learn and forecast. These agents are only appropriate for some of the changing patterns in the time series data, and they fail to describe other changing patterns. For the upper levels of the hierarchy, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to determine how to shift among those local models for a changing trend. With the hierarchical learning structure, multiple agents work alternatively and the limitation of a single agent can be overcome. To evaluate the prediction performance, we mainly adopt the prediction accuracy of changing tendency of the next time (up or down), which is measured by the changing direction hit-rate. Experiments have been performed on several well-known stock indexes and stock markets. The results show that the proposed method achieves good performance.

The findings suggest that the long-run and short-run relationships between the stock market and the three risk ratings variables of each country respond asymmetrically to shocks for all of the five BRICS, but at different speeds and depending on the direction of the shock, underpinning the differences in profit opportunities among these countries. The adjustment is faster for the individual BRICS following a positive shock (than a negative shock), except for Russia. Despite their grouping, the stock markets of the five BRICS countries are dissimilar and can add to diversification benefits in portfolios. ?? 2013.",

Then, we investigate the possible consequences of instabilities in empirical correlation coefficient measurements on optimal portfolio selection. We rely on previously published works which provide a framework allowing us to take into account possible risk underestimations due to the non-optimality of the portfolio weights being used in order to distinguish such non-optimality effects from risk underestimations genuinely due to non-stationarities.

				"abstract": "Purpose - The aim of this paper is to study both the information content of accounting figures and the speed at which the new information is incorporated into stock prices. Design/methodology/approach - The sample is composed of 117 overnight announcements published by Reuters during the period 2001-2003. For every date, the event is classified into one of three categories: good news, bad news or no news. The paper uses intraday event study methodology to examine market reaction just before and just after the event. Findings - The intraday analysis reveals several results. Firstly, investors react positively to good news and negatively to bad news. Secondly, abnormal returns dissipate within 15 min. Thirdly, prices converge to equilibrium more quickly for good news than for bad news. Fourthly, we present evidence of price reversal 30 min following bad news announcements. Finally, earnings releases are accompanied by a rise in volume which remains even after the equilibrium price is attained. Research limitations/implications - Price discovery is analyzed only in the stock market. It is pertinent to verify if the option market and foreign markets can contribute to the incorporation of new information into stock prices. Practical implications - This work can help investors to determine their trading strategies around earnings announcements. The paper shows that it is not possible to realize trading profits after 15 min following the time of the announcement. Originality/value - The study contributes to both financial accounting and microstructure literature. First, it focuses on the information content of accounting figures using very short horizon (intraday analysis). Second, the paper sheds light on the role of the Euronext preopening period in the incorporation of the overnight information flow.",

				"abstract": "As financial time series are inherently noisy and non-stationary, it is regarded as one of the most challenging applications of time series forecasting. Due to the advantages of generalization capability in obtaining a unique solution, support vector regression (SVR) has also been successfully applied in financial time series forecasting. In the modeling of financial time series using SVR, one of the key problems is the inherent high noise. Thus, detecting and removing the noise are important but difficult tasks when building an SVR forecasting model. To alleviate the influence of noise, a two-stage modeling approach using independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector regression is proposed in financial time series forecasting. ICA is a novel statistical signal processing technique that was originally proposed to find the latent source signals from observed mixture signals without having any prior knowledge of the mixing mechanism. The proposed approach first uses ICA to the forecasting variables for generating the independent components (ICs). After identifying and removing the ICs containing the noise, the rest of the ICs are then used to reconstruct the forecasting variables which contain less noise and served as the input variables of the SVR forecasting model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the Nikkei 225 opening index and TAIEX closing index are used as illustrative examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the SVR model with non-filtered forecasting variables and a random walk model.",

The analysis finds that the long-run impact of an increase in stock prices and house prices is in general higher in countries with a market-based financial system. The sensitivity of consumption to changes in stock wealth is about twice as large as the sensitivity to changes in housing wealth. Splitting the sample into the 1980s and 1990s shows that both countries with a market-based financial system and countries with a bank-based financial system moved toward a higher degree of responsiveness of consumption to changes in stock prices and house prices.",

A random walk model is rejected both for bull and bear markets. Although it ts the data better, a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model is also found to be inconsistent with the very long bull markets observed in the data. The strongest effect of increasing interest rates is found to be a lower bear market hazard rate and hence a higher likelihood of continued declines in stock prices.",

				"abstract": "This paper provides an asset pricing theory of the segmented Chinese stock markets. In Chinese stock markets, a local firm issues two classes of shares: A shares are available only to Chinese citizens, and B shares are available only to foreign citizens. In a setting where domestic investors can invest only in A shares and foreign investors can invest in both B shares and other foreign shares, the price differences between A shares and B shares depend on investors' attitudes toward risk, the correlations between B shares and foreign shares and investors' expectations about future returns. The empirical implications of this theory are supported by evidence in China's stock market. Cross-sectional differences between prices of A shares and B shares are correlated with investors' attitudes toward risk and correla- tions between B shares and foreign shares. Time series variability in the discounts of B shares is highly positively correlated. However, the discounts are not correlated with real interest rates. Regulatory changes may explain part of the variability of B shares' discounts over time.",

				"abstract": "The technical analysis of financial time series and in particular the prediction of future developments is a challenging problem that has been addressed by many researchers and practitioners due to the possible profit. We provide a forecasting technique based on a certain machine learning paradigm, namely support vector machines (SVM). SVM gained more and more importance for practical applications in the past years as they have excellent generalization abilities due to the principle of structural risk minimization. However, standard kernel functions for SVM are not able to compare time series of variable length appropriately, i.e., when we assume that these time series must be scaled in a non-linear way. Therefore, we use the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique as a kernel function. We demonstrate for two financial time series (FDAX and FGBL futures) that excellent results can be obtained with this approach.",

A grey self-organizing map (GreySOM) is a mechanism integrating GM(1,1), GRG, and SOM, and is a novel method for predicting financial time series. It classifies time-series differencing data in a SOM structure through grey correlation, and corrects the predicted values of the data to achieve more ideal predicted values of the data to achieve more ideal predicted values. The experimental results show that GreySOM has an excellent forecasting ability, and can help investors predict future stock price indices and grasp profit-making opportunities.",

				"abstract": "Following the recently introduced concept of transfer entropy , we attempt to measure the information flow between two financial time series, the Dow Jones and DAX stock index. Being based on Shannon entropies, this model-free approach in principle allows us to detect statistical dependencies of all types, i.e. linear and nonlinear temporal correlations. However, when available data is limited and the expected effect is rather small, a straightforward implementation suffers badly from misestimation due to finite sample effects, making it basically impossible to assess the significance of the obtained values. We therefore introduce a modified estimator, called effective transfer entropy , which leads to improved results in such conditions. In the application, we then manage to confirm an information transfer on a time scale of one minute between the two financial time series. The different economic impact of the two indices is also recovered from the data. Numerical results are then interpreted on one hand as capability of one index to explain future observations of the other, and on the other hand within terms of coupling strengths in the framework of a bivariate autoregressive stochastic model. Evidence is given for a nonlinear character of the coupling between Dow Jones and DAX.",

Considering this approach the financial data is modeled using Ordered Fuzzy Numbers (OFNs) called further by Ordered Fuzzy Candlesticks (OFCs). The use of them allows modeling uncertainty associated with financial data and maintaining more information about price movement at assumed time interval than comparing to commonly used price charts (e.g. Japanese Candlestick chart). Thanks to well-defined arithmetic of OFN, one can construct models of fuzzy time series, such as an Ordered Fuzzy Autoregressive Process (OFAR), where all input values are OFC, while the coefficients and output values are arbitrary OFN; in the form of classical equations, without using rule-based systems. In an empirical study ordered fuzzy autoregressive models are applied to modeling and predict price movement of futures contracts on Warsaw Stock Exchange Top 20 Index. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Before the market crash, a sharp rise in a measure of the collective behavior was observed. It was shown to be associated with news including the words ”financial crisis.” They did not impact stock prices severely alone, but they exacerbated the pessimistic mood that prevailed among stock market participants.

				"abstract": "This paper presents a set of tools, which allow gathering information about the frequency components of a time-series. We focus on the concepts rather than giving too much weight to mathematical technicalities. In a ldotsrst step, we discuss spectral analysis and ldotsltering methods. Spectral analysis can be used to identify and to quantify the di¤erent frequency components of a data series. Filters permit to capture specildotsc components (e.g. trends, cycles, seasonalities) of the original time- series. Both spectral analysis and standard ldotsltering methods have two main drawbacks: (i) they impose strong restrictions regarding the possible processes underlying the dynamics of the series (e.g. stationarity), and, (ii) they lead to a pure frequency-domain representation of the data, i.e. all information from the time-domain representation is lost in the operation. In a second step, we introduce wavelets, which are relatively new tools in economics and ldotsnance. They take their roots from ldotsltering methods and Fourier analysis. But they overcome most of the limitations of these two methods. Indeed their principal advantages are the following: (1) they combine information from both time-domain and frequency-domain and, (2) they are also very ‡exible and do not make strong assumptions concerning the data generating process for the series under investigation.",

				"abstract": "Over the past decade, the advances in our understanding of stem cell biology and the role of stem cells in diseases, such as colorectal cancer, have been remarkable. In particular, discoveries related to the control of stem cell proliferation and how dysregulation of proliferation leads to oncogenesis have been foremost. For intestinal stem cells, the WNT family of growth factors, and events such as the regulation of the nuclear localization of beta-catenin, seem to be central to normal homeostasis, and mutations in the components of these pathways seem to lead to the development of colorectal cancer. A paradigm of abnormal stem cell biology is illustrated by patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, who have mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. The wild-type protein encoded by this gene is important for the prevention of mass beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and the subsequent overtranscription of cell cycle proteins. This review discusses the basic mechanisms behind stem cell regulation in the gut and follows their role in the natural history of tumor progression.",

				"abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between consumption growth and the stock market for the G7 markets primarily using panel estimation techniques. We consider whether consumption growth is affected by stock returns and the dividend yield. The use of returns determines the existence of a wealth effect, while the use of the dividend yield can determine whether consumption is affected by short-term deviations of prices from fundamental value (bubbles) as well as expectations of future economic behaviour. Panel unit root tests confirm the stationarity of each variable, although high persistence is noted in the dividend yield. Regression results support a significant relationship between the dividend yield and consumption growth, such that a fall in the yield (high prices relative to dividends) is associated with higher future consumption. This result is robust across different empirical specifications to control for high persistence and possible cross-sectional dependence. Results for returns differ across the specifications but are typically supportive of a positive relationship. Overall, we argue our results support the view that when stock prices deviate from their fundamental path this has an effect on future consumption. This may have important implication with regard to how policy-makers deal with stock market bubbles, both positive and negative. textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Our approach combines pseudo-maximum-likelihood fitting of GARCH models to estimate the current volatility and extreme value theory (EVT) for estimating the tail of the innovation distribution of the GARCH model. We use our method to estimate conditional quantiles (VaR) and conditional expected shortfalls (the expected size of a return exceeding VaR), this being an alternative measure of tail risk with better theoretical properties than the quantile. Using backtesting of historical daily return series we show that our procedure gives better 1-day estimates than methods which ignore the heavy tails of the innovations or the stochastic nature of the volatility. With the help of our fitted models we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to estimating the conditional quantiles of returns over multiple-day horizons and find that this outperforms the simple square-root-of-time scaling method.",

If they came to know about the exact factors influencing the stock prices, they will invest in stocks confidently. This study examines the empirical relationship between the stock prices, financial fundamentals and macroeconomic factors in Karachi Stock Exchange. By applying the dynamic panel Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique on the data of 221 firms during 1995-2006, the analysis attempts to obtain efficient parameter estimates and to check the consistency of the link between stock price behavior, company fundamentals and macroeconomic factors. Several studies have been conducted to identify the factors of stock prices for a variety of countries, and the results have been mixed. It is found that previous behavior of stock prices, company size, previous earnings per share are the most important factors. In addition, macroeconomic indicators like, GDP growth, rate of interest and financial depth have significant relationship with the stock prices. Market to book value, share turnover ratio and inflation can also influence the stock price behavior. The corporate reforms of 2002 are responsible of increase in stock prices from 2002 to 2006. Investors in Pakistan have to decide which stock should be purchased. The results of this study will provide guideline to the investors in stock selection. While taking decisions they should take into account company informations as well as macroeconomic situation of the country simultaneously. The companies can set their policies and strategies in the light of relatively important factors, for business survival and success. The possible impact of macroeconomic factors may help the policy makers while setting monetary and fiscal policies.",

				"abstract": "Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",

				"abstract": "The class of ARM (Auto-Regressive Modular) processes is a versatile class of nonlinear autoregressive schemes with modulo-1 reduction and additional transformations. It generalizes the class of TES (Transform-Expand-Sample) processes in that it admits dependent innovation sequences. Both TES and ARM processes are designed to produce high-fidelity models from stationary empirical time series by fitting a strong statistical signature consisting of the empirical marginal distribution (histogram) and the empirical autocorrelation function. More specifically, they guarantee the matching of arbitrary empirical distributions and permit the approximation of the leading empirical autocorrelations, simultaneously. This paper provides a brief review of ARM processes and their fundamental properties, and outlines an ARM modeling methodology. It then illustrates the efficacy of financial modeling using the ARM methodology, by fitting TES models to empirical financial data. The models are then applied to the generation of financial Monte Carlo scenarios, and the forecasting of future values via point estimates and confidence intervals.",

The findings indicate that analysts' revised forecasts made in response to a management earnings forecast differ depending on the level of uncertainty communicated by management's guidance and the stock price reaction to it. Lower (higher) stock price leads to lower (higher) analysts' forecasts when uncertainty about future earnings is high, but not when uncertainty about future earnings is low. Overall, the evidence suggests that the documented association between prior security returns and analysts' earnings forecasts is due, at least in part, to the influence of stock price on analysts' earnings forecasts.",

The basic idea is that in spite of the high stochasticity in average there might be special local situations where there local order exist and the predictability is considerably higher than in average. In order to check this assumption we discretise the time series and investigate the frequency of the continuation of definite words of length n first. We prove the existence of relatively long-range correlations under special conditions. The higher order Shannon entropies and the conditional entropies (dynamical entropies) are calculated, characteristic fluctuations are found. Instead of the dynamic entropies which yield mean values of the uncertainty/predictability we finally investigate the local values of the uncertainty/predictability and the distribution of these quantities.",

				"abstract": "We investigate the use of the Hurst exponent, dynamically computed over a weighted moving time-window, to evaluate the level of stability/instability of financial firms. Financial firms bailed-out as a consequence of the 20072008 credit crisis show a neat increase with time of the generalized Hurst exponent in the period preceding the unfolding of the crisis. Conversely, firms belonging to other market sectors, which suffered the least throughout the crisis, show opposite behaviors. We find that the multifractality of the bailed-out firms increase at the crisis suggesting that the multi fractal properties of the time series are changing. These findings suggest the possibility of using the scaling behavior as a tool to track the level of stability of a firm. In this paper, we introduce a method to compute the generalized Hurst exponent which assigns larger weights to more recent events with respect to older ones. In this way large fluctuations in the remote past are less likely to influence the recent past. We also investigate the scaling associated with the tails of the log-returns distributions and compare this scaling with the scaling associated with the Hurst exponent, observing that the processes underlying the price dynamics of these firms are truly multi-scaling. textcopyright 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The degree of multifractality displayed by different stocks is found to be positively correlated to their depth in the hierarchy of cross-correlations. We propose a dynamical model that reproduces this observation along with an array of other empirical properties. The structure of this model is such that the hierarchical structure of heterogeneous risks plays a crucial role in the time evolution of the correlation matrix, providing an interpretation to the mechanism behind the interplay between cross-correlation and multifractality in financial markets, where the degree of multifractality of stocks is associated to their hierarchical positioning in the cross-correlation structure. Empirical observations reported in this paper present a new perspective towards the merging of univariate multi scaling and multivariate cross-correlation properties of financial time series. inancial",

				"abstract": "The aim of this paper is to investigate whether stock prices and exchange rates are related and whether there is evidence of convergence in the structure of this relationship across members of the European Union (EU). We then examine if this relationship differs, depending on whether the system of finance prevalent in a particular country is financial market based or dominated by the banking system. Given the differences between the financial systems in some European countries, the result is of importance to those countries that have joined the European Single Currency and those attempting to converge their economies in preparation for joining at a later date, such as the UK. Stock prices have been used extensively to explain and predict the exchange rate over recent years, as they reflect capital movements between stock markets. Equities have been incorporated into a number of empirical studies of the exchange rate and in general are shown to have a highly significant effect. The exchange rate model used in this study is a simple dynamic bivariate asset parity model, which can be derived from Roll's (1979) model. Following a discussion into the differing nature of the financial systems across the EU, the model and results from the empirical tests are discussed and finally there is a summary and a discussion on the policy implications.",

Current volatility modelling is introduced and compared with the advantages the wavelet-based analysis offers over conventional moving average based methods like the Bollinger bands. The immunity of the wavelet based de-noising to recording errors and transient shocks offers important help in analysing the long and short-term behaviour of financial data. The visualisation of transient shocks like crashes, in higher order wavelet coefficients is presented. The self-organising map neural network is introduced to aid the visualisation of the behaviour of indicator data and specifically the Dow-Jones industrial average. The features that are used for the visualisation are the approximation coefficients of 32-day trading periods with daily sampling of the closing value. The trajectory formed at different component levels shows the evolution of the indicator data from its beginning until September 1999.",

				"abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between an index of bank common stock prices and a variety of explanatory variables including interest rates on Treasury securities of various maturities and other economic variables. We also examine the relationship between the term structure of interest rates and bank stock prices. A sample of week ending values of the bank stock index is used as a proxy for the bank industry. The weekly closing interest rates for the 13-week Treasury bill, 5-year Treasury note, 10-year Treasury note, and the 30-year Treasury bond are used in the study. Other data used were the U.S. dollar index, the CRB index, the price of gold, the S&P500 stock index, the VIX stock market volatility index, and a measure of the yield curve. Data was taken from January 1998 through November 2009. Therefore, a total of approximately 620 cases of weekly observations are included in the study. In order to study the effects of term structure of interest rates on bank stock prices, we take the difference between the 10-year Note and the 13-week Bill. All variables are converted to a stationary series by taking first differences of each series. Multiple linear regression is then used to study the variables that can explain bank stock prices. A stepwise procedure was used to identify those variables with the strongest relationships in a multi-variable equation. Three independent variables were found with an R-squared of 0.619. The results of this study corroborate previous studies and have practical implications for investors and for bank managers.",

				"abstract": "This paper examines 12 maritime equity price series for behavioral stability and efficient market pricing for the 1989-2002 period. Five self-affine fractal analysis techniques for estimating the Hurst exponent, Mandelbrot-Lévy characteristic exponent, and fractal dimension are employed to explore the price series fractal properties. Techniques employed are rescaled-range analysis, power-spectral density analysis, roughness-length analysis, the variogram or structure function method, and wavelet analysis. Formal hypothesis tests provide evidence of a change in market behavior between the 1989-1994 and 1995-2002 periods. Hypothesis tests also provide evidence against efficient valuation of the maritime businesses sampled, supporting the multifractal model of asset returns (MMAR), and disconfirming the weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). Strong evidence is presented for antipersistence of some maritime equities in the sample, suggesting market participants habitually overreact to new information, and never learn not to. An important implication of this finding is that financial derivatives based on the sampled equities cannot be efficiently priced. textcopyright 2003 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Performance of this lsquoexpertrsquo group is compared to the performance of a lsquosemi-expertrsquo group composed of other banking professionals trained in portfolio management. It is found that while both groups attain their best discrimination performances in the four-week forecast horizon, they show their worst calibration and skill performances in the 12-week forecast horizon. Also, while experts perform better in all performance measures for the one-week horizon, semi-experts achieve better calibration for the four-week horizon.

Whether or not stock prices are characterised by a unit root have implications for the efficient market hypothesis, which asserts that returns of a stock market are unpredictable from previous price changes. The extant literature has found mixed evidence on the integrational properties of stock prices. In this paper, for the first time, we provide evidence on the unit root hypothesis for G7 stock price indices using the Lagrangian multiplier panel unit root test that allows for structural breaks. Our main finding is that stock prices are stationary processes, inconsistent with the efficient market hypothesis. textcopyright 2007.",

				"abstract": "The goal of this paper is to model the impact of oil prices on Vietnam's stock prices. We use daily data for the period 2000-2008 and include the nominal exchange rate as an additional determinant of stock prices. We find that stock prices, oil prices and nominal exchange rates are cointegrated, and oil prices have a positive and statistically significant impact on stock prices. This result is inconsistent with theoretical expectations. The growth of the Vietnamese stock market was accompanied by rising oil prices. However, the boom of the stock market was marked by increasing foreign portfolio investment inflows which are estimated to have doubled from US$0.9 billion in 2005 to US$1.9 billion in 2006. There was also a change in preferences from holding foreign currencies and domestic bank deposits to stocks local market participants, and there was a rise in leveraged investment in stock as well as investments on behalf of relatives living abroad. It seems that the impact of these internal and domestic factors were more dominant than the oil price rise on the Vietnamese stock market. textcopyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "A new method is proposed that allows a reconstruction of time series based on higher order multi-scale statistics given by a hierarchical process. This method is able to model financial time series not only on a specific scale but for a range of scales. The method itself is based on the general n-scale joint probability density, which can be extracted directly from given data. It is shown how based on this n-scale statistics, general n-point probabilities can be estimated from which predictions can be achieved. Exemplary results are shown for the German DAX index. The ability to model correctly the behaviour of the original process for different scales simultaneously and in time is demonstrated. As a main result it is shown that this method is able to reproduce the known volatility cluster, although the model contains no explicit time dependence. Thus a new mechanism is shown how, in a stationary multi-scale process, volatility clustering can emerge.",

Additionally, the standard segmentation methods employed in traditional clustering require instances to be classified exactly by attaching an event to a specific cluster at the exclusion of other clusters. This paper is an investigation into the predictive power of the clustering technique on stock market data and its ability to provide stock predictions that can be utilised in strategies that outperform the underlying market. This uses a brute force approach to the prediction of stock prices based on the formation of a cluster around the query sequence. The prediction is then applied in a model designed to capitalise on the derived prediction. The predictive accuracy of minimum distance clusters produced promising results with a prediction error incorporated into the forecast strategy.",

				"abstract": "Since removal of the peg in July 2005, China has entered a new era of a managed floating exchange rate system. Although many observers have raised concerns about the impact of such a policy change on China's trade surplus, less attention has been paid to its effects on financial markets. This paper investigates the impact of recent renminbi appreciation on stock prices in China since removal of the peg, using threshold cointegration and momentum threshold error-correction model (M-TECM). The results clearly illustrate that no short-run causal relation exists, and an asymmetric causal relationship running from the renminbi/U.S. dollar exchange rate to Chinese Shanghai A-share stock prices in the long run is based on M-TECM. Policy and the broader implications of the findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

				"abstract": "This paper examines the state of the United States economy as it emerges from the 2001 recession. A comparison of several central economic variables indicates that the 2001 recession was the mildest recession in the postwar period. In light of highly differentiated characteristics of recessions, the paper suggests that we differentiate among downturns by a five-category 'recession severity scale,' analogous to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. According to this approach, the 2001 recession fits in the least severe box, a 'category I recession,' along with the 1963 and 1967 non-recessions. The paper next examines the behavior of profits in recent years and shows that financial finagling has infected the aggregate profits numbers. Finally, the study constructs a measure of the forward-looking return on equities and concludes that the prospective real yield on equities in early 2002 is at its low point of the last half-century.",

				"abstract": "This study suggests time-based clustering models integrating change-point detection and neural networks, and applies them to financial time series forecasting. The basic concept of the proposed models is to obtain intervals divided by change points, to identify them as change-point groups, and to involve them in the forecasting model. The proposed models consist of two stages. The first stage, the clustering neural network modeling stage, is to detect successive change points in the dataset, and to forecast change-point groups with backpropagation neural networks (BPNs). In this stage, three change-point detection methods are applied and compared. They are: (1) the parametric approach, (2) the nonparametric approach, and (3) the model-based approach. The next stage is to forecast the final output with BPNs. Through the application to financial time series forecasting, we compare the proposed models with a neural network model alone and, in addition, determine which of three change-point detection methods performs better. Furthermore, we evaluate whether the proposed models play a role in clustering to reflect the time. Finally, this study examines the predictability of the integrated neural network models based on change-point detection. textcopyright World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.",

				"abstract": "The recent work in the author's research group on using$backslash$nindependent component analysis (ICA) for the analysis and prediction of$backslash$nfinancial time series is reviewed. ICA belongs to the group of linear$backslash$ntransform methods, with the goal to make a transform from the observed$backslash$nsignals into a signal space in which the signals are statistically$backslash$nindependent. Sometimes independence can be attained, especially in blind$backslash$nsource separation in which the observed signals are assumed to be linear$backslash$nmixtures of independent source components. Then the goal of ICA is to$backslash$ninvert the unknown mixing operation. Even when independence is not$backslash$npossible, as is often the case in financial time series, the ICA$backslash$ntransformation produces useful component signals whose dependence is$backslash$nreduced, and that are nonGaussian with a density allowing sparse coding.$backslash$nThe ICA transformation is also related to the temporal structure of the$backslash$nfound signals as measured by Kolmogorov complexity or its$backslash$napproximations. The signals are structured and hence may be easier to$backslash$ninterpret and predict. After discussing the ICA criterion within the$backslash$ncontext of linear signal transforms, the FastICA algorithm is reviewed.$backslash$nIt is a computationally efficient method for finding a subset or all of$backslash$nthe component signals. Then, two financial applications are covered:$backslash$ndecomposition of parallel financial time series of weekly sales into$backslash$nbasic factors, and prediction of mixture time series by linear$backslash$ncombinations of predictions on the ICA components",

Several statistical measures and tests were performed on the forecasting estimates and standard errors to evaluate the predictive performance of all models. A Jordan net which used as input to the neural network the coefficients resulting from a non-decimated Haar wavelet-based decomposition of the high and low stock prices showed consistently to have a superior modeling and predictive performance over the other models.

We use a sample of UK firms, which includes both R&D capitalizers and expensers. An important feature of our tests is our use of a two-equation system to control for the endogeneity of the accounting choice (i.e. self-selection). Proponents of capitalization claim that it enables management to better communicate information about the success of projects and their probable future benefits. Consistent with this, we find that capitalization is associated with higher FERC than expensing.",

If no constraints are imposed, it implies a large number of unknown coefficients. The most popular models propose parsimonious representations, imposing similar correlation structures to all the series or to groups of time series, but the choice of these groups is quite subjective. A statistical approach is proposed to detect groups of homogeneous time series in terms of correlation dynamics for one of the widely used models: the Dynamic Conditional Correlation model. The approach is based on a clustering algorithm, which uses the idea of distance between dynamic conditional correlations, and the classical Wald test, to compare the coefficients of two groups of dynamic conditional correlations. The proposed approach is evaluated in terms of simulation experiments and applied to a set of financial time series. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unique financial challenges faced by biotechnology companies developing therapeutics have contributed to the creation of a highly sensitive market, where stock prices are capable of great fluctuation. The potential for significant financial reward and the nature of the scientific review process make this industry susceptible to illegal share trading on nonpublic information. We examined stock prices of biotechnology products before and after announcement of Phase III clinical trial and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Panel results for indirect evidence of insider trading. METHODS: Biotechnology stock prices were recorded for 98 products undergoing Phase III clinical trials and 49 products undergoing FDA Advisory Panel review between 1990 and 1998. Prices were recorded for 120 consecutive trading days before and after public announcement of these two events. We compared the average change in stock price of successful products ('winners') with unsuccessful products ('losers') before the public announcement of results for both critical events. RESULTS: The difference between average stock price change from 120 to 3 days before public announcement of results of Phase III clinical trial winners (+27%) and losers (-4%) was highly significant (P = 0.0007). A similar but non-significant difference was observed between the average stock price of winning (+27%) and losing products (+13%) before FDA Advisory Panel review announcements (P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide indirect evidence that insider trading may be common in the biotechnology industry. Clinical investigators may wish to consider this issue before participating in any equity position in the biotechnology industry, especially if they are going to perform research for those companies.",

				"abstract": "There have been mixed results from numerous researches conducted not only in Nigeria but also in the rest of the world. Specifically, the relevance/irrelevance of dividend policy in valuation of firms' market share prices has always generated a controversy. The concern for this thus provided an inspiration to examine the impact of dividend policy on the stock prices of quoted firms in Nigeria. The research was conducted on 22 companies listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) using secondary data on their firms' fundamentals as available on their respective annual reports from 2009 to 2013 and their closing quoted share prices extracted from two Nigerian Dailies – The PUNCH and The GUARDIAN. Regression analysis, Correlation analysis and Granger Causality Test were used to test research hypothesis on 110 observations and the findings reveal that both dividend payout and retained earnings are significantly relevant in the market price per share of the companies. It is, therefore, recommended that optimal trade-off between dividend payment and retained earnings that would increase the shareholders' wealth in terms of cash and/or stock dividend as well as capital appreciation should be adopted by Nigerian listed firms.",

				"abstract": "This paper considers technical analysis used in financial analysis as a kind of control method based on monitoring of the market and presents a mathematical way of doing a similar job. For this purpose a stochastic differential equation model called the Micro-Market Structure model for the dynamics of currency exchange market is considered as an illustrative example. A use of filtered estimates of the unobserved variable of the model is suggested for monitoring the market to see whether the currency concerned is over-valued or under-valued in the currency exchange market. An example of the use of the filtered estimates of the variables for the currency allocation is illustrated.

				"abstract": "We develop a general equilibrium model in which stock prices of innovative firms exhibit \"bubbles\" during technological revolutions. In the model, the average productivity of a new technology is uncertain and subject to learning. During technological revolutions, the nature of this uncertainty changes from idiosyncratic to systematic. The resulting \"bubbles\" in stock prices are observable ex post but unpredictable ex ante, and they are most pronounced for technologies characterized by high uncertainty and fast adoption. We find empirical support for the model's predictions in 1830-1861 and 1992-2005 when the railroad and Internet technologies spread in the United States.",

Our empirical results show a significant causal relation from exchange rates to stock prices for Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. We also find a causal relation from the equity market to the foreign exchange market for Hong Kong, Korea, and Singapore. Further, while no country shows a significant causality from stock prices to exchange rates during the Asian crisis, a causal relation from exchange rates to stock prices is found for all countries except Malaysia. Our findings are robust with respect to various testing methods used, including Granger causality tests, a variance decomposition analysis, and an impulse response analysis. Our findings also indicate that the linkages vary across economies with respect to exchange rate regimes, the trade size, the degree of capital control, and the size of equity market. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

				"abstract": "It is well known that time series of returns are characterized by volatility clustering and excess kurtosis. Therefore, when modelling the dynamic behavior of returns, inference and prediction methods, based on independent and/or Gaussian observations may be inadequate. As bootstrap methods are not, in general, based on any particular assumption on the distribution of the data, they are well suited for the analysis of returns. This paper reviews the application of bootstrap procedures for inference and prediction of financial time series. In relation to inference, bootstrap techniques have been applied to obtain the sample distribution of statistics for testing, for example, autoregressive dynamics in the conditional mean and variance, unit roots in the mean, fractional integration in volatility and the predictive ability of technical trading rules. On the other hand, bootstrap procedures have been used to estimate the distribution of returns which is of interest, for example, for Val",

				"abstract": "This paper explores why IPO volume changes over time and how it relates to stock prices. We develop a model of optimal IPO timing in which IPO volume ,^$backslash$circuctuates due to time variation in market conditions. IPO waves in our model are caused by declines in expected market return, increases in expected aggregate profitability, or increases in prior uncertainty about the average future profitability of IPOs. The model has numerous predictions for IPO volume, including that IPO waves are preceded by high market returns and followed by low market returns. These as well as other predictions are supported empirically.",

				"abstract": "Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.",

				"abstract": "We provide a theoretical framework to explain the empirical finding that the estimated betas are sensitive to the sampling interval even when using continuously compounded returns. We suppose that stock prices have both permanent and transitory components. The discrete time representation of the beta depends on the sampling interval and two components labeled \"permanent and transitory betas\". We show that if no transitory component is present in stock prices then no sampling interval effect occurs. However, the presence of a transitory component implies that the beta is an increasing (decreasing) function of the sampling interval for more (less) risky assets. In our framework, assets are labeled risky if their \"permanent beta\" is greater than their \"transitory beta\" and vice versa for less risky assets. Simulations show that our theoretical results provide good approximations for the estimated betas in small samples. We provide empirical evidence about the presence of negative serial correlation and mean reversion in the returns of the portfolios considered. We discuss why our model is better able to provide an explanation for this sampling interval effect than other models in the literature. textcopyright 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

				"abstract": "As one of the main purposes of financial statements is to provide relevant information for investors, relationships between share prices and accounting variables have been widely researched. Early studies focus mainly on earnings, but attention has turned in recent years to valuation models that include the book value of the equity. Many of these studies cite the residual income model as their theoretical base and, with the growing emphasis on shareholder value, residual income measures are more commonly used in the business community to track financial performance. Given such trends, the purpose of this paper is to review the theoretical background of the residual income model and discuss results of empirical studies that use it. The study seeks an understanding of how published accounting information relates to share prices in the developed market in Asia, outside Japan. More specifically, the study aims to extend the international literature in market based accounting research by examining empirical evidence on relationships between share prices and the two summary accounting variables of equity book value and earnings for firms listed on the stock exchange in Malaysia. The findings imply that, the two accounting variables summarizing the balance sheet and the income statement, respectively, are significant factors in the valuation process, and that managers are justified in using the accounting system as a primary source of information for monitoring financial performance.",

				"abstract": "We respond to the issues discussed by Farmer and Lillo (FL) related to our proposed approach to understanding the origin of power-law distributions in stock price fluctuations. First, we extend our previous analysis to 1000 US stocks and perform a new estimation of market impact that accounts for splitting of large orders and potential autocorrelations in the trade flow. Our new analysis shows clearly that price impact and volume are related by a square-root functional form of market impact for large volumes, in contrast to the claim of FL that this relationship increases as a power law with a smaller exponent. Since large orders are usually executed by splitting into smaller size trades, procedures used by FL give a downward bias for this power law exponent. Second, FL analyze 3 stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, and solely on this basis they claim that the distribution of transaction volumes do not have a power-law tail for the London Stock Exchange. We perform new empirical analysis on transaction data for the 262 largest stocks listed in the London Stock Exchange, and find that the distribution of volume decays as a power-law with an exponent $backslashapprox 3/2$ -- in sharp contrast to FL's claim that the distribution of transaction volume does not have a power-law tail. Our exponent estimate of $backslashapprox 3/2$ is consistent with our previous results from the New York and Paris Stock Exchanges. We conclude that the available empirical evidence is consistent with our hypothesis on the origin of power-law fluctuations in stock prices.",

				"abstract": "This paper analyzes the statistical evidence bearing on whether transitory components account for a large fraction of the variance in common stock returns. The first part treats methodological issues involved in testing for transitory return components. It demonstrates that variance ratios are among the most powerful tests for detecting mean reversion in stock prices, but that they have little power against the principal interesting alternatives to the random walk hypothesis. The second part applies variance ratio tests to market returns for the United States over the 1871-1986 period and for seventeen other countries over the 1957-1985 period, as well as to returns on individual firms over the 1926- 1985 period. We find consistent evidence that stock returns are positively serially correlated over short horizons, and negatively autocorrelated over long horizons. The point estimates suggest that the transitory components in stock prices have a standard deviation of between 15 and 25 percent and account for more than half of the variance in monthly returns. The last part of the paper discusses two possible explanations for mean reversion: time varying required returns, and slowly—decaying \"price fads\" that cause stock prices to deviate from fundamental values for periods of several years. We conclude that explaining observed transitory components in stock prices on the basis of move- ments in required returns due to risk factors is likely to be difficult.",

				"abstract": "This article focuses on the analysis of financial time series and their correlations. A method is used for quantifying pattern based correlations of a time series. With this methodology, evidence is found that typical behavioral patterns of financial market participants manifest over short time scales, i.e., that reactions to given price patterns are not entirely random, but that similar price patterns also cause similar reactions. Based on the investigation of the complex correlations in financial time series, the question arises, which properties change when switching from a positive trend to a negative trend. An empirical quantification by rescaling provides the result that new price extrema coincide with a significant increase in transaction volume and a significant decrease in the length of corresponding time intervals between transactions. These findings are independent of the time scale over 9 orders of magnitude, and they exhibit characteristics which one can also find in other complex systems in nature (and in physical systems in particular). These properties are independent of the markets analyzed. Trends that exist only for a few seconds show the same characteristics as trends on time scales of several months. Thus, it is possible to study financial bubbles and their collapses in more detail, because trend switching processes occur with higher frequency on small time scales. In addition, a Monte Carlo based simulation of financial markets is analyzed and extended in order to reproduce empirical features and to gain insight into their causes. These causes include both financial market microstructure and the risk aversion of market participants.",

The largest crash in the past decades is the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers which was followed by a trust-based crisis between banks due to high-risk trading in complex products. We introduce information dissipation length (IDL) as a leading indicator of global instability of dynamical systems based on the transmission of Shannon information, and apply it to the time series of USD and EUR interest rate swaps (IRS). We find in both markets that the IDL steadily increases toward the bankruptcy, then peaks at the time of bankruptcy, and decreases afterwards. Previously introduced indicators such as 'critical slowing down' do not provide a clear leading indicator. Our results suggest that the IDL may be used as an early-warning signal for critical transitions even in the absence of a predictive model.",

				"abstract": "The cross correlation coefficient has been widely applied in financial time series analysis, in specific, for understanding chaotic behaviour in terms of stock price and index movements during crisis periods. To better understand time series correlation dynamics, the cross correlation matrices are represented as networks, in which a node stands for an individual time series and a link indicates cross correlation between a pair of nodes. These networks are converted into simpler trees using different schemes. In this context, Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) are the most favoured tree structures because of their ability to preserve all the nodes and thereby retain essential information imbued in the network. Although cross correlations underlying MSTs capture essential information, they do not faithfully capture dynamic behaviour embedded in the time series data of financial systems because cross correlation is a reliable measure only if the relationship between the time series is linear. To address the issue, this work investigates a new measure called phase synchronization (PS) for establishing correlations among different time series which relate to one another, linearly or nonlinearly. In this approach the strength of a link between a pair of time series (nodes) is determined by the level of phase synchronization between them. We compare the performance of phase synchronization based MST with cross correlation based MST along selected network measures across temporal frame that includes economically good and crisis periods. We observe agreement in the directionality of the results across these two methods. They show similar trends, upward or downward, when comparing selected network measures. Though both the methods give similar trends, the phase synchronization based MST is a more reliable representation of the dynamic behaviour of financial systems than the cross correlation based MST because of the former's ability to quantify nonlinear relationships among time series or relations among phase shifted time series.",

				"abstract": "This paper investigates the correspondence between stock prices and firm fundamentals in Turkey. In pursuing our objective, we explore the relationship between firm-specific variation in stock returns and fundamentals in the context of a simple present value framework. We overcome the typical insufficiency of the spans of time-series accounting data in emerging market research, and the consequent loss of statistical testing power, by adopting a firm-level micro panel data approach. After properly accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, potential endogeneity bias, and volatility persistence, we find that firm-specific variation of stock returns in Turkey is only weakly correlated with alternative proxies of firm-specific variation in firm fundamentals and that the relationship is not robust to the influence of control variables such as the firm size. Our findings are, therefore, consistent with the usual perception that stock prices in emerging markets contain little firm-specific information.",

				"abstract": "The new digital revolution of big data is deeply changing our capability of understanding society and forecasting the outcome of many social and economic systems. Unfortunately, information can be very heterogeneous in the importance, relevance, and surprise it conveys, affecting severely the predictive power of semantic and statistical methods. Here we show that the aggregation of web users' behavior can be elicited to overcome this problem in a hard to predict complex system, namely the financial market. Specifically, we show that the combined use of sentiment analysis of news and browsing activity of users of Yahoo! Finance allows to forecast intra-day and daily price changes of a set of 100 highly capitalized US stocks traded in the period 2012-2013. Sentiment analysis or browsing activity when taken alone have very small or no predictive power. Conversely, when considering a news signal where in a given time interval we compute the average sentiment of the clicked news, weighted by the number of clicks, we show that for more the 50% of the companies such signal Granger-causes price returns. Our result indicates a \"wisdom-of-the-crowd\" effect that allows to exploit users' activity to identify and weigh properly the relevant and surprising news, enhancing considerably the forecasting power of the news sentiment.",

The period of our study is from 1st January, 1999 to 31st March, 2013. The daily data, credit ratings announcements, daily equity returns and daily Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) SENSEX Indexes are collected from PROWESS Database of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Subsequently, the data have been analyzed using event study methodology. We computed the abnormal returns using Mean Adjusted Model, Market Adjusted Model and Conditional Risk Adjusted Model (Standard Market Model). The abnormal returns obtained using the above mentioned(three)models are similar. The significance of abnormal returns have been tested using Student„t‟ test. The study reveals downgrades invite considerable negative reactions, whereas the upgrades attract negligible positive response",

				"abstract": "This study adds to the empirical evidence supporting a significant connection between ethics and profitability by examining the connection between published reports of unethical behaviour by publicly traded U.S. and multinational firms and the performance of their stock. Using reports of unethical behaviour published in the Wall Street Journal from 1989 to 1993, the analysis shows that the actual stock performance for those companies was lower than the expected market adjusted returns. Unethical conduct by firms which is discovered and publicized does impact on the shareholders by lowering the value of their stock for an appreciable period of time. Whatever their views on whether ethical behaviour is profitable, managers should be able to see a definite connection between unethical behaviour and the worth of their firm's stock. Stockholders, the press and regulators should find this information important in pressing for greater corporate and managerial accountability. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Overall, the empirical results indicate that each macro shock has important effects on real stock prices. The real stock price impulse responses to the various macro shocks conform to the standard present-value equity valuation model, and they shed considerable light on the well-known negative correlation between real stock returns and inflation. An historical decomposition indicates that the late 1990s surge in real stock prices is due to a series of favorable structural shocks emanating from different sectors of the US economy.",

It is argued that the inherent temporal capabilities of this type of network are suited to non-stationary data such as this. The performance of the spiking neural network was benchmarked against three systems: two \"traditional\", rate-encoded, neural networks; a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and a Dynamic Ridge Polynomial neural network, and a standard Linear Predictor Coefficients model. For this comparison three non-stationary and noisy time series were used: IBM stock data; US/Euro exchange rate data, and the price of Brent crude oil. The experiments demonstrated favourable prediction results for the Spiking Neural Network in terms of Annualised Return and prediction error for 5-Step ahead predictions. These results were also supported by other relevant metrics such as Maximum Drawdown and Signal-To-Noise ratio. This work demonstrated the applicability of the Polychronous Spiking Network to financial data forecasting and this in turn indicates the potential of using such networks over traditional systems in difficult to manage non-stationary environments.",

When the fractal dimension of a time series is non-integer, this is associated with two features: (1) inhomogeneity-extreme fluctuations at irregular intervals, and (2) scaling symmetries-proportionality relationships between fluctuations over different separation distances. In multivariate systems such as financial markets, fractality is stochastic rather than deterministic, and generally originates as a result of multiplicative interactions. Volatility diffusion models with multiple stochastic factors can generate fractal structures. In some cases, such as exchange rates, the underlying structural equation also gives rise to fractality. Fractal principles can be used to develop forecasting algorithms. The forecasting method that yields the best results here is the state transition-fitted residual scale ratio (ST-FRSR) model. A state transition model is used to predict the conditional probability of extreme events. Ratios of rates of change at proximate separation distances are used to parameterize the scaling symmetries. Forecasting experiments are run using intraday exchange rate futures contracts measured at 15-minute intervals. The overall forecast error is reduced on average by up to 7% and in one instance by nearly a quarter. However, the forecast error during the outlying events is reduced by 39% to 57%. The ST-FRSR reduces the predictive error primarily by capturing extreme fluctuations more accurately. Copyright textcopyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

We construct a model showing that less reliable accruals lead to lower earnings persistence. We then develop a comprehensive balance sheet categorization of accruals and rate each category according to the reliability of the underlying accruals. Empirical tests generally confirm that less reliable accruals lead to lower earnings persistence and that investors do not fully anticipate the lower earnings persistence, leading to significant security mispricing. These results suggest that there are significant costs associated with incorporating less reliable accrual information in financial statements. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

This study provides empirical evidence on how this will impact financial reports. First, evidence is provided of a positive association between stock prices and voluntarily recognized and disclosed identifiable intangible assets. Second, evidence is provided of a positive association between identifiable intangible assets and realized future period income. This provides insights into the nature of the information provided by intangible assets, and identifies a basis for the association between stock prices and identifiable intangible assets. This leads to the conclusion that identifiable intangible assets disclosures are value relevant, and that with the application of the restrictive recognition rules in AASB138 these disclosures in financial reports will be greatly diminished. textcopyright 2006 AFAANZ.",

				"abstract": "The anti-sweatshop movement burst in the American public's consciousness in the 1990s. By the late 1990s, an eclectic group of 43 American NGOs and a growing number of international organizations were engaged in the movement. But, as yet, there are no rigorous empirical studies of the impact of anti-sweatshop actions on those firms accused of relying on sweated labor. This paper addresses this lacuna by using the event study technique to empirically assess the impact of public disclosure of firms' sweatshop practices on their stock prices. The paper finds that public disclosure does indeed cause firms' stock prices to fall, sometimes substantially. This, no doubt, explains the rush by these firms to voluntary codes of conduct. The paper also shows that stock prices have reacted positively (and substantially) to the actions taken by one firm, Reebok, to adopt anti-sweatshop practices. These findings appear to confirm the wisdom of the public disclosure strategies used by the movement to get firms to change behavior. But because of the potential for voluntary codes of conduct to result in opportunistic behavior, the paper concludes by arguing that public disclosure will only really work if carried out by independent third party auditors.",

				"abstract": "BACKGROUND Phase III clinical trials and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory decisions are critical for success of new drugs and can influence a company's market valuation. Knowledge of trial results before they are made public (ie, \"inside information\") can affect the price of a drug company's stock. We examined the stock prices of companies before and after public announcements regarding experimental anticancer drugs owned by the companies. METHODS We identified drugs that were undergoing evaluation in phase III trials or for regulatory approval by the US FDA from January 2000 to January 2009. Stock prices of companies that owned such drugs were analyzed for 120 trading days before and after the first public announcement of 1) results of clinical trials with positive and negative outcomes and 2) positive and negative regulatory decisions. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS We identified public announcements from 23 positive trials and 36 negative trials and from 41 positive and nine negative FDA regulatory decisions. The mean stock price for the 120 trading days before a phase III clinical trial announcement increased by 13.7% (95% confidence interval = -2.2% to 29.6%) for companies that reported positive trials and decreased by 0.7% (95% confidence interval = -13.8% to 12.3%) for companies that reported negative trials (P = .09). In a post hoc analysis comparing the stock price averaged over 60 trading days before and after day -60 relative to the clinical trial announcement, the mean stock price increased by 9.4% for companies that reported positive trials and decreased by 4.5% for companies that reported negative trials (P = .03). Changes in company stock prices before FDA regulatory decisions did not differ statistically between companies with positive decision and companies with negative decisions. CONCLUSIONS Trends in company stock prices before the first public announcement differ for companies that report positive vs negative trials. This finding has important legal and ethical implications for investigators, drug companies, and the investment industry.",

				"abstract": "The paper presents a low complexity recurrent Functional Link Artificial Neural Network for predicting the financial time series data like the stock market indices over a time frame varying from 1day ahead to 1month ahead. Although different types of basis functions have been used for low complexity neural networks earlier for stock market prediction, a comparative study is needed to choose the optimal combinations of these for a reasonably accurate forecast. Further several evolutionary learning methods like the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and modified version of its new variant (HMRPSO), and the Differential Evolution (DE) are adopted here to find the optimal weights for the recurrent computationally efficient functional link neural network (RCEFLANN) using a combination of linear and hyperbolic tangent basis functions. The performance of the recurrent computationally efficient FLANN model is compared with that of low complexity neural networks using the Trigonometric, Chebyshev, Laguerre, Legendre, and tangent hyperbolic basis functions in predicting stock prices of Bombay Stock Exchange data and Standard & Poor's 500 data sets using different evolutionary methods and has been presented in this paper and the results clearly reveal that the recurrent FLANN model trained with the DE outperforms all other FLANN models similarly trained.",

				"abstract": "We study the problem of correlating micro-blogging activity with stock-market events, defined as changes in the price and traded volume of stocks. Specifically, we collect messages related to a number of companies, and we search for correlations between stock-market events for those companies and features extracted from the micro-blogging messages. The features we extract can be categorized in two groups. Features in the first group measure the overall activity in the micro-blogging platform, such as number of posts, number of re-posts, and so on. Features in the second group measure properties of an induced interaction graph, for instance, the number of connected components, statistics on the degree distribution, and other graph-based properties. We present detailed experimental results measuring the correlation of the stock market events with these features, using Twitter as a data source. Our results show that the most correlated features are the number of connected components and the number of nodes of the interaction graph. The correlation is stronger with the traded volume than with the price of the stock. However, by using a simulator we show that even relatively small correlations between price and micro-blogging features can be exploited to drive a stock trading strategy that outperforms other baseline strategies.",

				"abstract": "This study examines the relationship between Chinese renminbi (RMB) exchange rates and Chinese stock prices over the full study period of 20 July 2001 to 21 July 2011. The study also investigates the relationship between the exchange rate and ten industry- specific indices. Also examined is the effect of two specific events on the 'exchange rate/stock price' relationship: (1) the easing of exchange rate controls, and (2) the 2008 start of the global financial crisis. A long-run cointegration relationship is found during the full study period between exchange rates and the Shanghai A-share prices, and for nine of ten industry indices. Granger causality in one direction (i.e., from exchange rates to stock prices, or vice versa) or both directions is found for four of the industry-specific indices. Interestingly, both a long-run cointegration relationship and Granger causality are only found during the most volatile period of managed exchanged rates before the global financial crisis. Implications for Chinese monetary policy makers and global investors are provided. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor and Francis Ltd",

Up to this time, there has not been a systemized approach to uncover the \"driving forces\" behind stock purchasing and/or recommending. In this article, Dr. Kenneth Saban presents an in-depth review of a comprehensive financial community market research approach and a discussion of the applied corporate findings when he was Vice President, Corporate Communications, Midland-Ross Corporation. As Saban recounts, even though the results of this market research approach were not able to be fully applied because of the leveraged-buy-out of the company in 1986, the basic concept is applicable to any publicly traded company whose senior management desires a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of investor/shareholder buyer behavior. textcopyright 1987.",

These estimators measure tail dependence in different orthants, complementing the commonly studied positive (lower and upper) tail dependence. This approach is in line with the parametric analysis of general tail dependence. Under this unifying approach the different dependencies are analysed using the associated copulas. We generalise estimators of the lower and upper tail dependence coefficient to the general multivariate tail dependence function and study their statistical properties. Tail dependence measures come as a response to the incapability of the correlation coefficient as an extreme dependence measure. We run a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the performance of the nonparametric estimators. We also employ selected estimators in two empirical applications to detect and measure the general multivariate non-positive tail dependence in financial data, which popular parametric copula models commonly applied in the financial literature fail to capture.

This paper tests the null hypothesis that stock prices from exchanges in New York City have not been systematically affected by local weather against the alternative hypothesis that stock prices have been systematically affected by local weather. Rejection of the null hypothesis supports the view that security markets are systematically influenced by investor psychology and argues for including behavioral variables in models of asset-pricing. In addition, rejection of the null hypothesis supports the hypothesis that security markets are, to some degree, irrational, thereby casting doubt on the hypothesis that security markets reflect nothing but economic information. The organization of the article is as follows. Section I descrihes the data and argues that there is no economic rationale for the effect of local weather on security prices.

Contrary to the findings of previous research, a significant degree of interdependence was found between the stock price development of Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Surprisingly, the stock price developments of France and Italy were unaffected by such developments in other major European countries.

The financial data analysis domain is a promising field for research and application of Visual Analytics technology, as it prototypi- cally involves the analysis of large data volumes in solving complex analysis tasks. We introduce a Visual Analytics system for supporting the analysis of large amounts of financial time-varying indicator data. A system, driven by the idea of extending standard technical chart analysis from one to two-dimensional indi- cator space, is developed. The system relies on an unsuper- vised clustering algorithm combined with an appropriately designed movement data visualization technique. Several analytical views on the full market and specific assets are offered for the user to navigate, to explore, and to analyze. The system includes automatic screening of the potentially large visualization space, preselecting possibly interesting candidate data views for presentation to the user. The sys- tem is applied to a large data set of time varying 2-D stock market data, demonstrating its effectiveness for visual anal- ysis of financial data. We expect the proposed techniques to",

Statistically signifi- cant excess returns at the time of the publication of stock recommendations have been documented many times. Frequently these abnormal gains begin to accumulate long before the publication date. In most cases they reach their highs on the day the recommendations are disseminated to the public. With few exceptions a price reversal sets in shortly thereafter: Excess returns in recommended stocks are at least partially given up. Many stocks now enter a period of underperformance, earning significant negative returns. The return reversions indicate that such stock price reactions are due to price pressure from \"naive\" investors hoping to profit from the experts. However, most media lack any real information that is not yet reflected in stock prices. In short: There is no evidence that stock recommendations published in the media offer any systematic opportunity to outperform the market. The evidence leads to the opposite conclusion: That investors who follow such advice will lose in the long run.",

				"abstract": "The detection of long range dependence (LRD) is an important task in time series analysis. LRD is often summarized by the well-known Hurst parameter (or exponent) H ∈ [0, 1], which can be estimated by a number of methods. Some of these techniques are designed to be applied to signals behaving as a stationary fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), whereas others imply that the analyzed time series behave as a non-stationary fractional Brownian motion (fBm). Moreover, some estimators do not yield the Hurst parameter but indexes related to H and ranging outside the unit interval. Therefore, the fGn or fBm nature of the studied time series has to be preliminarily analyzed before applying any estimation method, and the relationships between H and the indexes resulting from the analyses have to be taken into account to obtain coherent results. Since fGn-like series represent the increments of fBm-like processes and both the signals are characterized by the same H value by definition, estimators designed for fGn-like series can be applied to fBm-like sequences after preventive differentiation, and conversely estimators designed for fBm-like processes can be applied to fGn-like series after preventive integration. The signal characterization is particularly important when H is estimated on financial time series because the returns represent the first difference of price time series, which are often assumed to behave like self-affine sequences. The analysis of simulated fGn and fBm time series shows that all the considered methods yield comparable H values when properly applied. The reanalysis of several market price time series already studied in the literature points out that a correct application of the estimators (supported by a preventive signal classification) yields homogeneous H values allowing for a useful cross-validation of results reported in different works. Moreover, some conclusions reported in the literature about the anti-persistence of some financial series are shown to be incorrect because of the inappropriate application of the estimation methods. textcopyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.

				"abstract": "This paper provides an exhaustive review of the literature on the characterization of financial time series. A stylized fact is a term in economics used to refer to empirical findings that are so consistent across markets that they are accepted as truth. Financial time series may be characterized by the following stylized facts. The autocorrelation of returns is largely insignificant. The distribution of returns is non-stationary (clustered volatility) and approximately symmetric with increasingly positive kurtosis as the time interval decreases and has a power law or Pareto-like tail. There are non-linearities in the mean and (especially) the variance of returns. Markets exhibit non-trivial scaling properties. Volatility exhibits positive autocorrelation, long-range dependence of autocorrelation, scaling, has a non-stationary log-normal distribution and exhibits non-linearities. Volume exhibits calendar effects and has a distribution that decays as a power law. Regarding calendar effects, intraday effects exist, the weekend effect seems to have all but disappeared, intramonth effects were found in most countries, the January effect has halved and holiday effects exist in some countries. There is about a 30% chance that stock market returns exhibit long memory, a 50% chance that foreign exchange returns exhibit long memory and an 80% chance that market volatility exhibits long memory. There is little evidence of lowdimensional chaos in financial markets. This note also includes a summary of the important literature on market microstructure and the order book.",

The method allows us to extend the description of the cross-correlation properties between two time series. MM-DCCA may provide new ways of measuring the nonlinearity of two signals, and it helps to present much richer information than multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) by sweeping all the range of scale at which the multifractal structures of complex system are discussed. Moreover, to illustrate the advantages of this approach we make use of the MM-DCCA to analyze the cross-correlation properties between financial time series. We show that this new method can be adapted to investigate stock markets under investigation. It can provide a more faithful and more interpretable description of the dynamic mechanism between financial time series than traditional MF-DCCA. We also propose to reduce the scale ranges to analyze short time series, and some inherent properties which remain hidden when a wide range is used may exhibit perfectly in this way. textcopyright 2014 Elsevier B.V.

				"abstract": "Financial time series data are large in size and dynamic and non-linear in nature. Segmentation is often performed as a pre-processing step for locating technical patterns in financial time series. In this paper, we propose a segmentation method based on Turning Points (TPs). The proposed method selects TPs from the financial time series in question based on their degree of importance. A TP's degree of importance is calculated on the basis of its contribution to the preservation of the trends and shape of the time series. Algorithms are also devised to store the selected TPs in an Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST) and to reconstruct the reduced sample time series. Comparison with existing approaches show that the time series reconstructed by the proposed method is able to maintain the shape of the original time series very well and preserve more trends. Our approach also ensures that the average retrieval cost is kept at a minimum.",

That credit-worthy companies must offer price discounts of more than 30% to sell a significant block of restricted stock illustrates the importance of liquidity to the valuation of common stock.",

				"abstract": "Investigations into business cycles have found money supply to be a lead variable to stock prices. However, some would argue that the stock market, being efficient, anticipates money supply changes and therefore, stock prices are lead variables to money supply changes. Recent developments in time series methods have facilitated the testing of these relationships through identifying bivariate and multivariate autoregressive models. However, in many cases, the results using different procedures contradict themselves and are in conflict with theoretical reasonings. In this paper the causal relationship is tested between fiscal and monetary policies and stock prices using Canadian data and bivariate andmultivariate autoregressive models.",

				"abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of past returns and trading volumes on the temporal behaviour of international market returns. We propose a class of nonlinear threshold time-series models with generalized autorearessive conditional heteroscedastic disturbances. Using Bayesian approach, an implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is used to obtain estimates of unknown parameters. The proposed family of models incorporates changes in log of volumes in the sense of regime changes and asymmetric effects on the volatility functions. The results show that when differences of log volumes are involved in the system of log return and volatility models, an optimum selection can be achieved. In all the five markets considered, both mean and variance equations involve volumes in the best models selected. Our best models produce higher posterior-odds ratios than that in Gerlach et al.'s (Phys. A Statist. Mech. Appl. 2006; 360:422-444) models, indicating that our return-volume partition of regimes can offer extra gain in explaining return-volatility term structure.

Around earnings announcements, however, IR firms cannot spin the news and their clients' returns are significantly lower. This pattern is consistent with positive media coverage increasing investor expectations, creating disappointment around hard information.

Whether audit qualifications have informational value to investors is a question that needs further investigation, as previous empirical studies on this issue yield mixed results. Moreover, a majority of the research papers in this area have been conducted in Anglo-Saxon countries, in contrast to continental European countries where very little attention has been paid to the auditors' role in stock markets. The present study is based on a large sample of qualified opinions (543 for the period 1986–1995), using different expected event dates and market models. The results of the study demonstrate the significant negative abnormal returns around the announcement dates of audit opinions. The empirical part of this study was carried out in the French market which has some significant differences from the UK and the USA markets. The author believes that the differences, in the area of reporting, level of disclosure, and accounting and auditing practices, can play an important role in the research field of event studies.",

All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. With regard to these results the importance of taurine and GABA as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed.",

Subsequently, we show that mean reversion makes stocks less risky for investors with long investment horizons. Next, we consider a mean-variance efficient investor and showhowmean reversion in stock prices affects such an investor's optimal portfolio weights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the investment decisions of long-term investors.",

				"abstract": "Progesterone and PGFM serum levels were estimated by RIA in patients with spontaneous and induced labor. Induction of labor was performed by amniotomy or by local application of prostaglandins. Mean progesterone serum levels were at 130 ng/ml at the time of admission into the labor-room, and declined to mean levels of some 50 ng/ml in all 3 groups of patients 30 minutes after placenta expulsion. Mean PGFM serum levels were 2,5 to 3,5 times higher in patients with spontaneous labor than in those in whom labor was induced. Parallel decline of progesterone and PGFM serum levels was noted in patients with spontaneous labor, whereas declining progesterone levels but increasing PGFM serum levels were observed in patients with induced labor. These data combine to suggest that an increase in PGFM serum levels may be the cause for the onset of labor. But, the question whether progesterone triggers these processes cannot be answered by the present observations.",

				"abstract": "Since structural changes in a possibly transformed financial time series may contain important information for investors and analysts, we consider the following problem of sequential econometrics. For a given time series we aim at detecting the first change-point where a jump of size a occurs, i.e., the mean changes from, say, m0 to m0 + a and returns to mo after a possibly short period s. To address this problem, we study a Shewhart-type control chart based on a sequential version of the sigma filter, which extends kernel smoothers by employing stochastic weights depending on the process history to detect jumps in the data more accurately than classical approaches. We study both theoretical properties and performance issues. Concerning the statistical properties, it is important to know whether the normed delay time of the considered control chart is bounded, at least asymptotically. Extending known results for linear statistics employing deterministic weighting schemes, we establish an upper bound which holds if the memory of the chart tends to infinity. The performance of the proposed control charts is studied by simulations. We confine ourselves to some special models which try to mimic important features of real time series. Our empirical results provide some evidence that jump-preserving weights are preferable under certain circumstances.",

In particular, we show how to uncover the local scaling (correlation) characteristics of the S&P index with the wavelet based effective H??lder exponent (Struzik, in: Fractals: Theory and Applications in Engineering, Dekking, L??vy V??hel, Lutton, Tricot, Springer, Berlin, 1999; Fractals 8 (2) (2000) 163). We use it to display the local spectral (multifractal) contents of the S&P index. In addition to this, we analyse the collective properties of the local correlation exponent as perceived by the trader, exercising various time horizon analyses of the index. We observe an intriguing interplay between such (different) time horizons. Heavy oscillations at shorter time horizons, which seem to be accompanied by a steady decrease of correlation level for longer time horizons, seem to be characteristic patterns before the biggest crashes of the index. We find that this way of local presentation of scaling properties may be of economic importance. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Contrary to what has been observed in other markets with a similar segmented structure, the China B shares trade at a discount relative to the A shares. We show that the phenomenon can still be explained by basic economic principles. Specifically, the existence of the H-share and the “red-chip” markets in Hong Kong provide good substitutes for the B-share market. We find that when more H shares and red chips are listed in Hong Kong, the B-share discount becomes larger. This is consistent with the model of differential demand elasticity proposed by Stulz and Wasserfallen (Stulz, R., Wasserfallen, W., 1995. Review of Financial Studies 8, 1019–1057).",

				"abstract": "A novel neural-network-based method of time series forecasting is presented in this paper. The method combines the optimal partition algorithm (OPA) with the radial basis function (RBF) neural network. OPA for ordered samples is used to perform the clustering for the samples. The centers and widths of the RBF neural network are determined based on the clustering. The difference of the objective functions of the clustering is used to adjust the structure of the neural network dynamically. Thus, the number of the hidden nodes is selected adaptively. The method is applied to stock price prediction. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Comparisons with the hard c-means (HCM) algorithm show that the proposed OPA method possesses obvious advantages in the precision of forecasting, generalization, and forecasting trends. Simulations also show that the OPA–orthogonal least squares (OPA–OLS) algorithm, which combines OPA with the OLS algorithm, results in better performance for forecasting trends.",

				"abstract": "Information about the relationship between alternative accounting procedures for financial reporting and investor behavior is important to three different groups of decision makers-financial accounting policy makers, corporate managers and investors. This paper presents a study of this relationship for accounting changes to and from the Lifo method of inventory costing. Studies of this relationship at the individual level in an experimental environment have the advantage of being able to test hypotheses about the existence of manipulative causality. But because of the absence of competing investors and sources of information in such an environment, the results from such studies are hard to generalize. Valuation theory models for studying this relationship at the market level have the disadvantage of being dominated by the scale factor and do not measure the association between changes. These models consider the pricing of each stock as an isolated problem. Another approach to the study of this relationship is to estimate the abnormal price changes associated with the accounting changes via the market model and a stationarity assumption about the risk of stocks. Given an inflationary environment and a few other assumptions, the adoption of Lifo results in reduced earnings and increased economic value of the firm. The opposite is true for the firms which give up Lifo in favor of Lifo or the moving average method. Measurement of abnormal price changes indicated that on average, stock price of the firms which changed to Lifo increased over the 12-month period immediately preceding the end of the fiscal year during which the change was made. This observation can be given two interpretations: (a) increase in price was the effect of accounting changes and (b) price rise merely reflected the good business prospects of the firm which, in turn, motivated management to bring about the accounting change. Lack of availability of data on the dollar effect of the accounting changes in most cases did not permit identification between these two cases. When steel firms, which constituted 19% of the sample, are excluded from analysis, the abnormal price increase becomes much smaller. The results still support the hypothesis that price changes follow the changes in the economic value of the firm against the alternative hypothesis that they follow the changes in reported earnings. As the sample of firms which abandoned Lifo is very small, no significant results could be obtained from its analysis. Since no evidence could be found to support the view that the reduction in the reported earnings of a firm which accompanies a switch to Lifo method is viewed by the stock market as a sign of adverse performance on the part of the corporation, corporate managements need not hesitate to adopt Lifo for fear of such adverse reaction. The study has two implications of interest to policy makers for financial accounting standards and investors: (a) the announcement of earnings report which includes an accounting change to Lifo does not cause any change in the price of the stock on average and (b) if the price rise observed in the year preceding the adoption of Lifo was caused by the accounting change, the possibility of the insiders making an unusual though small profit on the basis of this information exists. However, it could not be established if the observed price rise was caused by the accounting change, though it was accompanied by it. The research design used in this study assumes that the relative risk of firms does not change. This parameter can, however, change for various reasons. Preliminary measurements indicate that the relative risk of firms which switched to Lifo increased after the accounting change. It can be shown that changes in risk make the abnormal price changes measured by this design quite arbitrary. Research to develop estimates of relative risk and abnormal price changes when relative risk is unstable is now in progress. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

				"abstract": "Prediction of financial time series using artificial neural networks has been the subject of many publications, even if the predictability of financial series remains a subject of scientific debate in the financial literature. Facing this difficulty, analysts often consider a large number of exogenous indicators, which makes the fitting of neural networks extremely difficult. In this paper, we analyze how to aggregate a large number of indicators in a smaller number using -possibly nonlinear- projection methods. Nonlinear projection methods are shown to be equivalent to the linear Principal Component Analysis when the prediction tool used on the new variables is linear. Furthermore, the computation of the nonlinear projection gives an objective way to evaluate the number of resulting indicators needed for the prediction. Finally, the advantages of nonlinear projection could be further exploited by using a subsequent nonlinear prediction model. The methodology developed in the paper is validated on data from the BEL20 market index, using systematic cross-validation results.",

				"abstract": "Time series data are difficult to manipulate. When they can be transformed into meaningful symbols, it becomes an easy task to query and understand them. While most recent works in time series query only concentrate on how to identify a given pattern from a time series, they do not consider the problem of identifying a suitable set of time points based upon which the time series can be segmented in accordance with a given set of pattern templates, e.g., a set of technical analysis patterns for stock analysis. On the other hand, using fixed length segmentation is only a primitive approach to such kind of problem and hence a dynamic approach is preferred so that the time series can be segmented flexibly and effectively. In view of the fact that such a segmentation problem is actually an optimization problem and evolutionary computation is an appropriate tool to solve it, we propose an evolutionary segmentation algorithm in this paper. Encouraging experimental results in segmenting the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index using 22 technical analysis patterns are reported",

The research derives its results from the study of empirical data for five years from January 2006 to December 2010. These findings point towards the developing phase that Indian economy is going through over the last six decades. This entails that stock market in India still cannot be symbolized as the “indicator” of financial health of the country. The study clearly indicates that since real economic variables are not affecting the stock market index hence certainly some exogenous variables do exist having an impact on the stock prices.",

The main difficulty of applying M4 model to real data is due to the estimation of a large number of parameters in the model and the intractability of its joint likelihood. In this paper, we consider a sparse M4 random coefficient model (SM4R), which has a parsimonious number of parameters and it can potentially capture the major stylized facts exhibited by devolatized asset returns found in empirical studies. We study the probabilistic properties of the newly proposed model. Statistical inference can be made based on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach. We also demonstrate through real data analysis that the SM4R model can be effectively used to improve the estimates of the Value-at-Risk (VaR) for portfolios consisting of multivariate financial returns while ignoring either temporal or cross-sectional tail dependence could potentially result in serious underestimate of market risk. textcopyright 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

				"abstract": "Some analysts suggest that the Fed should target equity prices. This article questions this proposal on both theoretical and empirical grounds. There is a negative correlation between the fed funds rate and the price-earnings ratio, but it arises from a significant correlation of each measure with inflation. In the long run, stock prices are independent of the fed funds rate. The real fed funds rate is stationary. Cointegration evidence indicates a negative long-run relationship between stock prices and inflation, in turn implying that higher stock prices are associated with lower inflation and a lower fed funds rate, contrary to recent proposals. Taylor Rule estimates show that the Fed has implicitly acted on this well-founded relationship, exactly the opposite reaction that has been proposed recently. More important, such reactions take into account the correct indicator properties of stock prices, that they anticipate lower inflation, instead of acting as an independent cause of higher inflation.

The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility of SVM in financial time series forecasting by comparing it with a multi-layer back-propagation (BP) neural network. Five real futures contracts that are collated from the Chicago Mercantile Market are used as the data sets. The experiment shows that SVM outperforms the BP neural network based on the criteria of normalized mean square error (NMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), directional symmetry (DS) and weighted directional symmetry (WDS). Since there is no structured way to choose the free parameters of SVMs, the variability in performance with respect to the free parameters is investigated in this study. Analysis of the experimental results proved that it is advantageous to apply SVMs to forecast financial time series. textcopyright 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

				"abstract": "To what extent can agents' learning and incomplete information about the \"true\" underlying model generating stock returns explain findings of excess volatility and predictability of returns in the stock market? In this paper we analyse two models of recursive learning in the stock market when dividends follow a (trend-)stationary autoregressive process. The asymptotic convergence properties of the models are characterized and we decompose the variation in stock prices into rational expectations and recursive learning components with different rates of convergence. A present-value learning rule is found to generate substantial excess volatility in stock prices even in very large samples, and also seems capable of explaining the positive correlation between stock returns and the lagged dividend yield Self-referential learning, where agents' learning affect the law of motion of the process they are estimating, is shown to generate some additional volatility in stock prices, though of a magnitude much smaller than present value learning [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Different hypotheses on how investors form expectations about future dividends after a break are proposed and analyzed. A model in which investors do not have full information about the parameters of the dividend process but gradually update their beliefs as new information arrives is shown to induce skewness, kurtosis, volatility clustering, and serial correlation in stock returns after a break.",

In a firm specific approach, we find that stock prices reflect future earnings information to a greater extent in firms' post-options-listing period than in their pre-options-listing period. In a cross-sectional setting, we find that stock prices of firms with readily available options trading reflect future earnings information more and earlier than those of firms without available options. In a sub-sample containing only firms with listed options, we find that stock prices of firms with a high level of options trading volume reflect future earnings information more and earlier than those of firms with a low level of options trading volume. Findings in this study support the proposition that options trading results in more current information that is relevant for predicting future earnings being impounded into stock prices. Consistent with this proposition, we also document an inverse relation between options trading and the amount of new information provided by earnings announcements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

But many of the actions of these hormones occur too rapidly to be explained in this manner, particularly their effects on the central nervous system. This text deals with recent discoveries showing that steroids can modulate the activity of some neurotransmitters. It explores the role of GABA as an important regulator of neuronal activity in the central nervous system and its inhibitory action as mediated via the GABA receptor and potentiated by steroids. In addition, the binding of steroids to cell membranes, the components involved and the outcome of such interactions are described. Also discusses possible uses of steroids as anesthetics and anticonvulsants. textcopyright 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

				"abstract": "Provides statistical tools and techniques needed to understand today's financial markets The Second Edition of this critically acclaimed text provides a comprehensive and systematic introduction to financial econometric models and their applications in modeling and predicting financial time series data. This latest edition continues to emphasize empirical financial data and focuses on real-world examples. Following this approach, readers will master key aspects of financial time series, including volatility modeling, neural network applications, market microstructure and high-frequency financial data, continuous-time models and Ito's Lemma, Value at Risk, multiple returns analysis, financial factor models, and econometric modeling via computation-intensive methods. The author begins with the basic characteristics of financial time series data, setting the foundation for the three main topics: Analysis and application of univariate financial time series Return series of multiple assets Bayesian inference in finance methods This new edition is a thoroughly revised and updated text, including the addition of S-Plus(R) commands and illustrations. Exercises have been thoroughly updated and expanded and include the most current data, providing readers with more opportunities to put the models and methods into practice.

				"abstract": "This study aims to enhance the understanding of logarithmic asset returns. In particular, more emphasis is given to the long memory property of financial returns, a well documented stylized fact. However, in the presence of structural breaks other studies suggest that statistical tools such as the AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) can wrongly indicate long memory. We propose an insensitive to structural breaks method to test for dependence between distant observations. Furthermore, a model which combines memory in returns and memory in absolute returns is developed in two stages. First return series are segmented with respect to changes in the volatility and then the two parameters of the model are estimated. To assess the capabilities of the model, historical prices of the Standard and Poor 500 Index (S&P500), Financial Time Stocks Exchange 100 Index (FTSE100), Deutsche Boerse Ag German Stock Index (DAX) and Crude Oil are used.1 Given the estimated parameters and the volatility within each regime, 10000 vectors are generated and compared to the original data in terms of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistical test. The obtained results suggest that long memory is present and provide evidence that the additional memory information captured by the model improves financial returns modeling.",

				"abstract": "The Bayesian evidence framework is applied in this paper to least squares support vector machine {(LS-SVM)} regression in order to infer nonlinear models for predicting a financial time series and the related volatility. On the first level of inference, a statistical framework is related to the {LS-SVM} formulation which allows one to include the time-varying volatility of the market by an appropriate choice of several hyper-parameters. The hyper-parameters of the model are inferred on the second level of inference. The inferred hyper-parameters, related to the volatility, are used to construct a volatility model within the evidence framework. Model comparison is performed on the third level of inference in order to automatically tune the parameters of the kernel function and to select the relevant inputs. The {LS-SVM} formulation allows one to derive analytic expressions in the feature space and practical expressions are obtained in the dual space replacing the inner product by the related kernel function using Mercer's theorem. The one step ahead prediction performances obtained on the prediction of the weekly 90-day T-bill rate and the daily {DAX30} closing prices show that significant out of sample sign predictions can be made with respect to the {Pesaran-Timmerman} test statistic",

				"abstract": "Logically, inflation should be a universal phenomenon. Therefore, the test of stocks' overall performance relative to inflation is one of capital values, without reinvestment of dividends, relative to the value of money. In fact, using the consumer price index as a benchmark for the value of money in real terms is far less satisfactory. It does not adequately reflect what people actually buy in order to live, or the rising standard of living. It is artificially lowered by productivity the improvement in manufacturing, as is readily evident from the way the real cost of computers has always declined precipitously. Investors cannot be complacent about inflation by any measure. If you get an after-tax return of 3 percent and inflation is 3 percent, the purchasing power of both the capital and the income is declining by 3 percent in real terms. Even with a relatively low inflation rate of 3 percent annually, the value of money declines by 50 percent every 24 years. Therefore, money managers for the likes of family trusts and pension funds face a challenge in order to maintain the real value of their portfolio. Using expanded credit to deal with a financial crisis or the deflation of a bubble merely leads to the inflation of further bubbles. The bailout of an individual company, the stock market, or the government of a bankrupt third world country seldom leads to well-founded prosperity and stability.",

It also provides analytical information about the Greek Stock Market and the regulations underlying it, which have been taken into account in the present thesis. Moreover, previous studies of important academic scholars are presented and discussed, in order for the reader to attain the appropriate theoretical knowledge about the examined issue. Finally, significant abnormal activity is documented throughout the multiple event-windows that are employed and therefore, the null hypothesis, which supports the irrelevance theory as introduced by Miller and Modigliani (1961), is rejected.

				"abstract": "Financial time series forecasting has become a challenge because it is noisy, non-stationary and chaotic. Most of the existing forecasting models for this problem do not take market sentiment into consideration. To overcome this limitation, motivated by the fact that market sentiment contains some useful forecasting information, this paper uses textual information to aid the financial time series forecasting and presents a novel text mining approach via combining ARIMA and SVR (Support Vector Regression) to forecasting. The approach contains three steps: representing textual data as feature vectors, using ARIMA to analyze the linear part and developing a SVR model based only on textual feature vector to model the nonlinear part. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, quarterly ROEs (Return of Equity) of six security companies are chosen as the forecasting targets. Comparing with some existing state-of-the-art models, the proposed approach gives superior results. It indicates that the proposed model that uses additional market sentiment provides a promising alternative to financial time series prediction. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

As accuracy and completeness of information held by the investor rise, the probability for better decision making also rises. Similarity search based outlier detection in financial time series is key to making better decisions for many investment strategies and portfolio management techniques. This motivates people to utilize numerous data mining techniques to discover similarities from massive financial time series data pools. The research introduces a novel pruning based Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to search for similarity among financial time series in high dimensional space using securities in the SP500 index as experimental data. The algorithm is based on vertical and horizontal dimension reduction algorithms [11] and a unique similarity measurement definition [12] with the time value concept.

				"abstract": "We calculate the Hurst exponent H(t) of several time series by dynamical implementation of a recently proposed scaling technique: the detrending moving average (DMA). In order to assess the accuracy of the technique, we calculate the exponent H(t) for artificial series, simulating monofractal Brownian paths, with assigned Hurst exponents H. We next calculate the exponent H(t) for the return of high-frequency (tick-by-tick sampled every minute) series of the German market. We find a much more pronounced time-variability in the local scaling exponent of financial series compared to the artificial ones. The DMA algorithm allows the calculation of the exponent H(t), without any a priori assumption on the stochastic process and on the probability distribution function of the random variables, as happens, for example, in the case of the Kitagawa grid and the extended Kalmann filtering methods. The present technique examines the local scaling exponent H(t) around a given instant of time. This is a significant advance with respect to the standard wavelet transform or to the higher-order power spectrum technique, which instead operate on the global properties of the series by Legendre or Fourier transform of qth-order moments. textcopyright 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

				"abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the impact of accounting standards on the information content of stock prices using a sample of 44 countries from around the world. Following Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000), we use stock market synchronicity as a proxy for the information content of stock prices. We find that the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards or U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles per se is not related to such information content, but that better accounting standards are helpful only in countries with proper reporting incentives. In particular, we find a significantly negative relationship between stock price synchronicity and accounting standards in countries with a common-law legal origin, better shareholder protection, and stricter legal enforcement. Our results also extend Jin and Myers (2006) by allowing corporate transparency to be endogenously determined, at least partially, by reporting standards and incentives. Our findings suggest that a well-functioning capital market requires both high-quality accounting standards and strong legal and enforcement mechanisms.",

				"abstract": "In this paper we use the independent component analysis (ICA) as a powerful tool to do some research on the financial time series underlying pattern recognizing, especially focusing on the U.S. mutual fund prices with the JADEop algorithm. Four years of daily prices of the top 10 performers of the U.S. mutual fund specified in technology are observed as the input signals to ICA and we get the ICs that hide in the market, establish its structure and have great effectiveness on the fund prices, that is, the ICs buildup the underlying pattern of the financial time series. The results of ICs indicate that in the underlying pattern that we get, the frequently large changing ICs are responsible for the major changes in the mutual fund prices, the sudden event (such as new technique releasing) will fluctuate the whole mutual fund prices greatly and most low frequent fluctuating ICs do little to the whole price change in the market. Especially, the change in the field on which the mutual fund focuses will have some effect on fund price. With ICA, maybe we can get a new view on recognizing the underlying pattern of financial time series.",

Consistent with internal monitoring of management, there is an inverse relation between the probability of a management change and a firm's share performance.

It follows that oil firms with significant investment interests in Katrina's path should incur negative stock price returns in some time frame. This event study analyzed 15 firms with interests in the Gulf of Mexico and examines the effect of Hurricane Katrina on stock price's risk adjusted rate of return before and after August 30, 2005. Results show stock returns dropping significantly prior to Hurricane Katrina reaching land. These results support semi-strong market efficiency, reflecting that the market rapidly anticipated the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Appropriate statistical tests for significance conducted in this study show that Hurricane Katrina had a significant impact on the risk adjusted rate of return on selected oil company stock prices over the event study period. Specifically, results show that oil company stock price returns started a significant downturn up to 25 days prior to the hurricane event on August 30, 2005",

				"abstract": "This study documents the return and volatility spillover effect between the stock prices of Chinese new energy and fossil fuel companies using the asymmetric BEKK model. Based on daily samples taken from August 30, 2006 to September 11, 2012, the dynamics of new energy/fossil fuel stock spillover are found to be significant and asymmetric. Compared with positive news, negative news about new energy and fossil fuel stock returns leads to larger return changes in their counter assets. News about both new energy and fossil fuel stock returns spills over into variances of their counter assets, and the volatility spillovers depend complexly on the respective signs of the return shocks of each asset. The empirical results demonstrate that new energy and fossil fuel stocks are generally viewed as competing assets, that positive news about new energy stocks could affect the attractiveness of fossil fuel stocks and that new energy stock investment is more speculative and riskier than fossil fuel stock investment. These results have potential implications for asset allocation, financial risk management and energy policymaking. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Both the record events in the daily stock prices themselves and the records in the daily returns are discussed. In both cases we try to describe the record statistics of the stock data with simple theoretical models. The daily returns are compared to i.i.d. RVs and the stock prices are modeled using a biased random walk, for which the record statistics are known. These models agree partly with the behavior of the stock data, but we also identify several interesting deviations. Most importantly, the number of records in the stocks appears to be systematically decreased in comparison with the random walk model. Considering the autoregressive AR(1) process, we can predict the record statistics of the daily stock prices more accurately. We also compare the stock data with simulations of the record statistics of the more complicated GARCH(1, 1) model, which, in combination with the AR(1) model, gives the best agreement with the observational data. To better understand our findings, we discuss the survival and first-passage times of stock prices on certain intervals and analyze the correlations between the individual record events. After recapitulating some recent results for the record statistics of ensembles of N stocks, we also present some new observations for the weekly distributions of record events. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Although we find little herding by mutual funds in the average stock, we find much higher levels in trades of small stocks and in trading by growth-oriented funds.

A law of one co-integrating vector of prices is proposed for the exchange rate and domestic and overseas stock prices. Markets must therefore be efficient in long-run equilibrium because no arbitrage opportunities exist. However, arbitrage activity via the disequilibrium error correction allows above-average (risk-adjusted) returns to be earned in the short run. The elimination of these arbitrage opportunities means that stock market inefficiency in the short run ensures stock market efficiency in the long run.",

Consequently, the effect of central dopamine (DA) augmentation on stimulated PRL release was determined in 5 healthy men. Regular insulin (o.1 U/kg i.v.), a potent central stimulus for PRL secretion, and TRH, a direct hypophyseal stimulus, were given alone or one hour after the third and fourth doses, respectively, of L-dopa plus the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa (Sinemet 20/200 or 25/250 every 6 hours). PRL increased from 26.6 +/- 5.8 to 48.8 +/- 5.2 ng/ml (p less than 0.01) 40 minutes after insulin administration. In contrast, during Sinemet therapy the hypoglycemia-mediated PRL release did not occur, and the PRL levels were significantly lower than after insulin alone from 40 through 180 minutes. Following TRH, neither the maximal PRL rise (69.3 +/- 3.2, TRH alone vs 48.7 +/- 19.8 ng/ml, TRH + Sinemet) nor the maximal increment (37.5 +/- 5.5 vs 29.9 +/- 20.3 ng/ml) was significantly affected by Sinemet. It is concluded that central DA augmentation abolishes central but not peripherally mediated PRL release.",

The model is named as TBSM-SVR. Over the last decade, SVR has been a popular forecasting model for nonlinear time series problem. The general segmentation method, that is, the piecewise linear representation (PLR), has been applied to locate a set of trading points within a financial time series data. However, owing to the dynamics in stock trading, PLR cannot reflect the trend changes within a specific time period. Therefore, a trend based segmentation method is developed in this research to overcome this issue. The model is tested using various stocks from America stock market with different trend tendencies. The experimental results show that the proposed model can generate more profits than other models. The model is very practical for real-world application, and it can be implemented in a real-time environment.textless/ptextgreater",

The returns of the two indices are shown to have nice scaling behaviors and belong to stable distributions according to the criterion of Lévy's alpha stable distribution condition. An approach catching characteristic features of financial time series based on the concept of instantaneous phase is further proposed to study the phase distribution and correlation. Analysis of the phase distribution concludes that return time series fall into a class which is different from other nonstationary time series. The correlation between returns of the two indices probed by the distribution of phase difference indicates that there was a remarkable change of trading activities after the event of the 9/11 attack, and this change persisted in later trading activities.",

				"abstract": "The accurate prediction of time-changing covariances is an important problem in the modeling of multivariate financial data. However, some of the most popular mod- els suffer from a) overfitting problems and multiple local optima, b) failure to capture shifts in market conditions and c) large com- putational costs. To address these prob- lems we introduce a novel dynamic model for time-changing covariances. Over-fitting and local optima are avoided by following a Bayesian approach instead of computing point estimates. Changes in market condi- tions are captured by assuming a diffusion process in parameter values, and finally com- putationally efficient and scalable inference is performed using particle filters. Experi- ments with financial data show excellent per- formance of the proposed method with re- spect to current standard models. 1.",

Understanding factors that affect stock price movements are very important for an investor. The sample data started in 2000-2013. Result shows that there are differences in the factors that affect stock prices in Indonesia and Malaysia. In Indonesia, the share price is more influenced by past stock prices. In Malaysia, its stock price is strongly influenced by inflation. Although there is a difference, the Government of Indonesia and Malaysia need to increase monetary stability as monetary stability could affect investors' perceptions and influence fluctuations in stock prices.",

However, we can not accurately predict the fluctuations in the future in most cases. In this paper, we try to apply information granulation in the prediction of financial time series. First, we fuzzy grain the financial time series. Then, we use RBF neural network which has good ability of nonlinear mapping to predict future trend of fluctuations and fluctuating range. Simulation result shows that this method can accurately predict the trend of fluctuations and the fluctuating range, which can provide reliable reference for the decision makers of investment.",

				"abstract": "Recently, Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been applied to finan- cial time series prediction. Typical characteristics of financial time series are non- stationary and noisy in nature. The volatility, usually time-varying, of the time series therefore contains some valuable information about the series. Previously, we had proposed to use the volatility in the data to adaptively changing the width of the margin in SVR. We have noticed that upside margin and downside margin would not necessary be the same, and we have observed that their choice would affect the upside risk, downside risk and as well as the overall prediction performance. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to adapt the asymmetrical margins using momentum.We applied and compared this method to predict the Hang Seng Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average.",

				"abstract": "We investigate the use of the rough set model for financial time-series data analysis and forecasting. The rough set model is an emerging technique for dealing with vagueness and uncertainty in data. It has many advantages over other techniques, such as fuzzy sets and neural networks, including attribute reduction and variable partitioning of data. These characteristics can be very useful for improving the quality of results from data analysis. We demonstrate a rough set data analysis model for the discovery of decision rules from time series data for example, the New Zealand stock exchanges. Rules are generated through reducts and can be used for future prediction. A unique ranking system for the decision rules based both on strength of the rule and stability of the rule is used in this study. The ranking system gives the user confidence regarding their market decisions. Our experiment results indicate that the forecasting of future stock index values using rough sets obtains decision ruleswith high accuracy and coverage. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

				"abstract": "Undergraduate and graduate students in finance courses made probabilistic forecasts of the quarterly changes in the stock prices and earnings of publicly traded companies. Consistent with previous findings (Sta??l von Holstein, 1972), the overall accuracy of both price and earnings forecasts was very modest; subjects would have been more accurate had they predicted that price changes were equally likely to fall into any of the specified ranges. Also consistent with earlier suggestions of \"inverted\" expertise effects, undergraduate subjects were more accurate than graduate subjects. Decompositional analyses of subjects' judgments were consistent with the hypothesis that graduate students' relatively poor accuracy was affected by their greater tendency to report forecasts that varied from one stock to the next instead of the same forecast for every one. It is argued that the most plausible explanation is that the graduate subjects responded to cues they thought were predictive, but which actually were not. However, it cannot be ruled out completely that the graduate subjects attended to truly predictive cues, but were simply unable to use them appropriately. ?? 1991.",

The aim of this study is to determine which of these two expectations formation hypotheses best explains the behaviour of investors in the Malaysian stock market. We employ the Chow (1988) methodology in which the two expectations hypotheses are applied to the present value model of stock prices for Malaysian stock market data consisting of stock prices and dividends for 13 companies over 21 years. Our results provide strong statistical support for the adaptive expectations hypothesis. This finding is in line with the empirical findings of Chow and his collaborators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

				"abstract": "In financial time series forecasting, the problem that we often encounter is how to increase the prediction accuracy as possible using the financial data with noise. In this study, we discuss the use of supervised neural networks as a meta-learning technique to design a financial time series forecasting system to solve this problem. In this system, some data sampling techniques are first used to generate different training subsets from the original datasets. In terms of these different training subsets, different neural networks with different initial conditions or training algorithms are then trained to formulate different prediction models, i.e., base models. Subsequently, to improve the efficiency of predictions of metamodeling, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is used as a pruning tool to generate an optimal set of base models. Finally, a neural-network-based nonlinear metamodel can be produced by learning from the selected base models, so as to improve the prediction accuracy. For illustration and verification purposes, the proposed metamodel is conducted on four typical financial time series. Empirical results obtained reveal that the proposed neural-network-based nonlinear metamodeling technique is a very promising approach to financial time series forecasting. textcopyright 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We develop new momentum strategies based on the ratio of the current stock price to each of five different reference points in past prices: 52-week high, 52-week median, 52-week low, half-year high, and 2-year high. We measure their investment performance on the basis of the Fama and French 3-Factor and Momentum Model (Carhart four-factor model), and further employ the technique of nested trading strategies to measure incremental performance. The strategy based on the ratio of current stock price to its 52-week high price is the most profitable, and its performance is robust when tested over a wide range of financial and economic factors. Our results provide strong new evidence of the investment merits of a momentum trading strategy based on the 52-week high price ratio, and add new weight to challenges to the hypothesis that the stock market is efficient in the semi-strong sense.",

Firstly, by transferring the time series into multifractal spectra plots, it confirms the existence of multifractal phenomenon in Shanghai stock market. Secondly, it analyzes statistically the correlations between the parameters of the multifractal spectra (the width of the multifractal spectrum and the difference of the fractal dimensions of the maximum and the minimum probability subsets) and the variation of the closing index, the logarithmic return and the gain probability. It indicates that the multifractal analysis can reveal insightful information about the market trend",

				"abstract": "The existence of forbidden patterns, i.e., certain missing sequences in a given time series, is a recently proposed instrument of potential application in the study of time series. Forbidden patterns are related to the permutation entropy, which has the basic properties of classic chaos indicators, such as Lyapunov exponent or Kolmogorov entropy, thus allowing to separate deterministic (usually chaotic) from random series; however, it requires fewer values of the series to be calculated, and it is suitable for using with small datasets. In this paper, the appearance of forbidden patterns is studied in different economical indicators such as stock indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite), NYSE stocks (IBM and Boeing), and others (ten year Bond interest rate), to find evidence of deterministic behavior in their evolutions. Moreover, the rate of appearance of the forbidden patterns is calculated, and some considerations about the underlying dynamics are suggested.",

				"abstract": "The objective of this research is to evaluate the unobserved effect of cross-listing on stock prices of companies from Latin America. Particularly, we study the impact of the issuance of ADRs on volatility and efficiency in the local markets. We employ GARCH models to assess the impact on volatility, once the ADR has been issued, and ARMA models to evaluate the impact on efficiency, once the ADR is listed. Overall, we find that in 82% of the analyzed cases, at least one result shows improvement (i.e. lower volatility and/or more efficiency, once the corresponding ADR has been issued). Further, we find that once the electronic trading systems are implemented in emerging markets, there is an improvement in terms of the information environment, thus reducing the effects of cross-listing. This study contributes to the financial literature because it tests the impact of cross-listing on two specified market microstructure variables, namely volatility and efficiency, through a robust methodology.",

				"abstract": "In this thesis, we develop an extension of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that addresses two of the most important challenges of financial time series modeling: non-stationary and non-linearity. Specifically, we extend the HMM to include a novel exponentially weighted Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to handle these two challenges. We show that this extension allows the HMM algorithm to model not only sequence data but also dynamic financial time series. We show the update rules for the HMM parameters can be written in a form of exponential moving averages of the model variables so that we can take the advantage of existing technical analysis techniques. We further propose a double weighted EM algorithm that is able to adjust training sensitivity automatically. Convergence results for the proposed algorithms are proved using techniques from the EM Theorem. Experimental results show that our models consistently beat the S&P 500 Index over five 400-day testing periods from 1994 to 2002, including both bull and bear markets. Our models also consistently outperform the top 5 S&P 500 mutual funds in terms of the Sharpe Ratio.",

				"abstract": "In this thesis, we develop an extension of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that addresses two of the most important challenges of financial time series modeling: non-stationary and non-linearity. Specifically, we extend the HMM to include a novel exponentially weighted Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to handle these two challenges. We show that this extension allows the HMM algorithm to model not only sequence data but also dynamic financial time series. We show the update rules for the HMM parameters can be written in a form of exponential moving averages of the model variables so that we can take the advantage of existing technical analysis techniques. We further propose a double weighted EM algorithm that is able to adjust training sensitivity automatically. Convergence results for the proposed algorithms are proved using techniques from the EM Theorem. Experimental results show that our models consistently beat the S&P 500 Index over five 400-day testing periods from 1994 to 2002, including both bull and bear markets. Our models also consistently outperform the top 5 S&P 500 mutual funds in terms of the Sharpe Ratio.",

This paper models the behavior of stock prices basing on Self-excited multifractal(SEMF) process and deduces that probability distributions of the model are exponentially tempered Pareto distributions(CGMY model).The maximum likelihood estimator can be used to estimate parameters of CGMY and SEMF. The empirical results demonstrate that the SEMF process have a very good ability to quantitatively describe the complicated behavior of stock prices.",

It utilizes real-world examples and real financial data throughout the book to apply the models and methods described. The author begins with basic characteristics of financial time series data before covering three main topics: analysis and application of univariate financial time series; the return series of multiple assets; and Bayesian inference in finance methods. Timely topics and recent results include: Value at Risk (VaR) High-frequency financial data analysis Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods Derivative pricing using jump diffusion with closed-form formulas VaR calculation using extreme value theory based on a non-homogeneous two-dimensional Poisson process Multivariate volatility models with time-varying correlations Ideal as a fundamental introduction to time series for MBA students or as a reference for researchers and practitioners in business and finance, Analysis of Financial Time Series offers an in-depth and up-to-date account of these vital methods.",

				"abstract": "The massive amount of financial time series data that originates from the stock market generates large amounts of complex data of high interest. However, adequate solutions that can effectively handle the information in order to gain insight and to understand the market mechanisms are rare. In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector. Both applications allow the user to perform investigative exploration techniques and interactive visual analysis in real-time.",
